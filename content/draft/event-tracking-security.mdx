I felt Przax was a kindred spirit. One aspect we had in common.

Add header data to events to allow tracibility. The idea is that every interaction with a microservice should write
itself into the head metadata.

RESTful -> in prototol -> for HTTP, use a header. For Kafka, use a header

Take this idea one step further leads to the idea of non-refutable traceability.

Sign each interaction with a microservice instance.

Expensive..? Depends. It increases message size.

What about a distributed ledger...?

Why not logging...? I like the idea of wrapping everything up together.
