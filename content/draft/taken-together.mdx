Why take both certificates...?

--

A professional certification has two costs. One direct, one hidden.

The cost of preparing for two certificates with considerable overlap together is less than separately.

---

Preparing together for two related certificates improves the chance of answering peripheral questions correctly.

---

Taking the less important certificate first allows you to learn from the experience of the first before taking
on the second.

And passing the first gives you confidence for the second.

---

It improves morale. Taking two improves the odds that you'll pass at least one. And if you prepare especially well
or the certificate proves to be less demanding than you anticipate then passing both.

---

Failing both means you really weren't ready. It's a clear signal you need to reconsider your strategy.

Maybe you'd be happy in some other role. Or maybe you need to change how you prepare.

---

But is one worthwhile...? Often, yes. Show don't tell. It shows you've been studying. If you book a second try then
should your dream opportunity turn up in the cooling off period, you can truthfully say that you're preparing.
