Streams is strongly typed in Java using generics. If you want to avoid POJOs for example, since the data may be messy
or you're experimenting but don't want to pay the cost of adding serialization code, you could type as Json Node
and the use the serializers from connect.

Pojo serializers aren't that tough.
