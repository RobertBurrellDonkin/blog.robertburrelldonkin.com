import {Gatsby, ReactLink} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Before my injury, I used to create little quiz cards for exams. Cue cards. Questions on one side, answers on the other.
Best for simple, low-hanging fruit. Postcard sized or small. Colourful.

They work in two ways. The first is that the act of curated creation builds a certain sort of memory. The cards lead
you back to all the thoughts and ideas linked when you created them.

The second is to refresh key concepts just before the test. Once you're into the final push, it's too late to strive
for understanding. Doing so it likely to be counterproductive, at best wasting energy, at worst trigger a harmful
cognitive reorganisation. Better to focus on polishing up simple recall. Even better if these act as associative
gateways to deeper networks. 

But I no longer enjoy enough writing to be able to take on this sort of stuff.

So I coded up a project using (you guessed it) <Gatsby/> and <ReactLink/>. Yes, bit risky and the code's scruffy. I think
it worked okay, though. An experiment I hope to repeat one day.
