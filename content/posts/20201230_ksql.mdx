import {KSQL as KsqlCourse} from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"

import {KSQL as KsqlDB, KafkaStreams, Kafka} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Finishing <KsqlCourse/> set me thinking...

When investigating some new technology, one of the things I seek to discover is **why** people should learn this technology.
With my architects hat on, **why** becomes most particular **when**. *When* should an architect ask that a team
adopt this technology.

Yes, <KsqlDB/> is often advertised as lowering the learning curve for SQL people. I'm sure it does. The feeling I had
playing around with it is very familiar from the days way back when I coded a lot of data access stuff.

But that's just a smart query language design choice.

Being able to recycle old human resources lying around is nice but not precisely a notable architectural feature.

Thanks to Kafka Streams and richer events streaming semantics, <Kafka/> now encompasses an ever expanding range of
use cases within the distributed relational data stores. Which makes adding SQL support a natural move.

In particular, query languages are great for discovery. KSQL enjoys an interactive command line.

Going beyond the fine syntactic sugar, for me this ad hoc querying is the key architectural feature.
