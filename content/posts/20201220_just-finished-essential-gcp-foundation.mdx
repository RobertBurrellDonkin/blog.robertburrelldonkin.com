import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

I'm focussing my continuing professional development on three areas. <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/gcp'>Google Cloud Platform</GatsbyLink> is one.


Just a quick note that I
completed [Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/3DT6HSMS454H) today.

This is the second part of the *Cloud Engineering with Google Cloud Professional Certificate*.
