They think it's all over. It is now.

[Flash is history.](https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/12/flash_is_dead/)

And thanks to [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) and [The Internet Archive](http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/)
this is an ideal opportunity to take a little walk down nostalgia lane.

Enjoy [curated collections](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_flash) of loops and games.

Thanks :-)
