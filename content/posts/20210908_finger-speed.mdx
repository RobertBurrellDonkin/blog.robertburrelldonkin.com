Perhaps some might wonder why I say: Coming Soon.

Why the delay...?

Well, here's a little tip: professional engineering is all about the speed at which you are able to produce high quality
features.

And speed is all about having the power of a modern refactoring IDE under your fingertips.

It takes me a while for my fingers to get back up to speed. Not just typing but also relearning all those shortcuts.

And I'm taking the time to make sure I have all the latest and greatest features mastered.

The main difference between a professional decorator and a skilled amateur isn't so much the results. I've seen talented
and highly skilled spare time decorators do amazing things. It's about the time it takes to produce the results.

I think it's the same in software engineering. Given enough time, a spare time coder with access to all the rich
resources of the web may be able to produce a great solution. But commercial development is all about delivering
business value by delivering high quality features in a timely and predictable fashion.

I'll need to get up to speed on video. So I may record some kata.
