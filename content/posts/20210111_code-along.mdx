Coding along with a video course is learning technique I've only recently adopted.

Like many things, there's a knack, I feel, an art to it

And one that's likely to take a little while to really master.

Time to catch my early impressions fresh.

My usual pattern is to speed read books for concepts. Ditto video. I'll catch up on the details
when I run into a need for them whilst coding.

Which works fine for polishing skills in professional use.

And kata are great for getting back up to speed.

But coding along also has advantages and disadvantages.

It's slower than speed reading but only a little slower than watching a video.

It ensures your fingers learn.

It's all details, for me. Coding along uses mental resources which might otherwise pondering the bigger picture.

Details are often useful, though, especially when certifying.
