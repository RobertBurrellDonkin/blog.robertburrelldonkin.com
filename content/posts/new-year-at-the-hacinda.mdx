Around the turn of the millienium, before the injury, when life was more intense, before internet radio was
all locked down into santized little boxes, I coded along to a lot repetitive beat music. Right into the flow.

This year <a href='https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/watch-haciendas-new-years-eve-19541916'>
    United We Stream</a> brought back all the goodness.

Thanks <a href='https://twitter.com/Sacha_Lord'>Sacha</a> and everyone involved for rolling back to better years.
