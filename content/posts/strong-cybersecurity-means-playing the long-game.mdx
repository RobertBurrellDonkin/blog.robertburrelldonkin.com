Google Handouts were disfunctional this lunchtime. Which sunk my plans.

Perhaps a coincidence.

Or perhaps fall out from
the [SolarWinds](https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/14/solarwinds_public_sector/) breech becoming public.

Upstream vendor compromises, like SolarWinds, have been both anticipated and feared. Bad news at this scale has been
long awaited. Organisations which secure just their perimeter – rather
than [defense-in-depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)) – are exceptionally vulnerable
to an upstream compromise of this sort.

I feel like saying this was inevitable. That too few computer science degrees, too few business schools and too few
political science majors really prepare their graduates properly.

But I'll say instead that this should be a wake up call for all professionals whether management or engineer.
Be willing in the future to take a stronger stand. Too many information security departments are
chronically understaffed. Everyone
in the industry can help them by taking the time to master the basics.

And as this news [mainstreams](https://www.newsweek.com/solarwinds-tip-iceberg-evidence-multiple-hacks-1555678), the
West starts to comprehend the geopolitical choices ahead. I'm sure we'll read all about aggressive options to attack
Russian speakers in the coming week, about ways to escalate and about the importance of deterrence.

Predictable negative reactions of this sort are likely to do more harm than good – just marionettes dancing at the
whim of the puppet masters.

The West needs to remember how to play the long game.

The West has locked out too many people from the educational opportunities need to fill the clear demand for
cybersecurity. Cheaper to train an army of cybersecurity defenders than to lob a dozen cruise missiles at some statelet
or other...
