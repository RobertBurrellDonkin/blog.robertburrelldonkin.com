*First Posted as a LinkedIn Article*

After what turned into quite long career break, I've decided returning to engineering. When Whitehall permits...

Living alone in an locality locked down almost constantly since March hasn't exactly been good for my social skills.
But rebuiling them will be an challenge for another month.

And I'll need to finish my continuing professional development plans
related to <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/kafka'>Apache Kafka</GatsbyLink>.


A couple of new aims -

 * return to technical blogging, and
 * get back up to speed on Spring

Wish me luck and I hope enjoy the best possible Christmas!
