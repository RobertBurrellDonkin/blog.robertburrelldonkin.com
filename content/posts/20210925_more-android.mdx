import {Android, Kotlin, Java, Google} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Spent most of today developing my <Android/> side project. Took me a little while to bring back everything freshly to
mind.

I'm getting back up to speed with <Java/> so that's the language I picked for this project. Notable that <Google/>
looks to be pushing developers strongly to <Kotlin/>.

More later, perhaps, but would probably be unwise for me to allow my enthusiasm to run away.
