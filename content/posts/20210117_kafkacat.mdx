import {KafkaCheatsheet} from "../../src/components/Cheatsheets"

Consulting engineers are supposed to bring a stock of tricks, tips and tool.

Discovering new tools, tips and tricks is important. [St√©phane Maarek's Kafka Series](https://www.kafka-tutorials.com/)
has been great. I've added many to my <KafkaCheatsheet/>
but Kafkacat is the one in particular that I enjoyed being reminded of.
