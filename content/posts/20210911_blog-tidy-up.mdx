I prefer to get my thoughts down quickly as a draft before returning to edit. I date the post based on when I had the
thought (rather than when I got round to editing and publishing).

The volume of posts hanging around in draft started to feel like a drag. So I've been spending today working through
and either promoting (to edited posts) or archiving.
