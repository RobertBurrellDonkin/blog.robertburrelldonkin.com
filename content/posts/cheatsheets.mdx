import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

Coming back to software engineering after a break, I think I might finally start to really understand the drive
to create cheatsheets *et al*.

So much so that I felt driven to start pulling together some of my own this week. Early days yet but
the <GatsbyLink to='/cheatsheets'>cheatsheets are here</GatsbyLink>.

On the Internet, it's [always Autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September).

Each Internet era has its golden, glowing Summer splendor before the masses caught on up, tuned in and
turned up.

In my mind, the early 00s were this golden era for search. At least for software developers.
The 'Net was a smaller place, then. Easier to find your way around.

Before Google, in the 90s searching for information about ```XML``` on Alta Vista meant wading through seemingly endless pages
of [NSFW](https://www.howtogeek.com/438957/what-does-nsfw-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/) soft core...

Google was different. Google was clean. Google was shiny. Google returned useful information; erudite and varied
opinions.

Now, it feels to me that search is entering a dark age. Same old sites. Same old opinions. So many sites culled.

And I find it increasing difficult to frame useful queries.

And when I do discover useful and interests site I am unable to rely on Google to turn them up again...

Which is why I feel the need to record information here for myself.

And why maybe you might find it useful too.
