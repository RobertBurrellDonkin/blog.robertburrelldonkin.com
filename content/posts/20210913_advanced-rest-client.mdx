import {Postman, AdvancedRestClient} from "../../src/components/Tech"

The best tools for REST have evolved over time. So it's important to try to keep in touch.

Back way back when, Chrome was my weapon of choice.

Then it was <Postman/>. Which remains excellent.

This morning, I stumbled upon <AdvancedRestClient/>. Though both are useful for exercising REST APIs, as a browser
based approach I think it may be complementary.

I'll have to give it a whirl next time I'm developing an API...
