I aim to blog everyday. So blogging becomes ingrained once more into a daily habit.

But I prefer to capture my raw thoughts then edit. And editing takes time.

Hopefully, editing and writing will become quicker and more fluent with practice but for the moment, I'm maintaining
a backlog. Which means catching up when I'm able.

My aim is to match the date of the post with the time when I captured the thought.
