import {Android, Kotlin, Java, Google} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Feels good to have completed my little <Android/> proof-of-concept in the weekend.

On reflection, I feel it's an important little step for me...

It was fun. Just developing a little app.

After the life changing injury in 2010, I've needed to live my life within my physical limits. This is a little
side project to assist me with an exercise programme. Being trapped alone with just my injury here in my half-repair
house for the strong and long local lockdown (around 15 months in total, I think) has been another tough time. My
physical and mental health took a pounding. This feels like the start of taking back control of my life and
proving to myself and others that even after the injury, I'm not quite finished yet.
