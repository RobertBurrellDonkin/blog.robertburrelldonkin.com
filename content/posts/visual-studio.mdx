import {VisualStudio, OpenSource, Microsoft, VB} from "../../src/components/Tech"

import {SimpleSteph} from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"

My brother and I taught ourselves to code on the ZX Spectrum. This allowed me to take the opportunity to get into
software development in the late 90s with <VB/>. Maybe I'll have some more to say on those days and how <Microsoft/>
taught itself to love <OpenSource/> later...

One aspect of consulting engineering is sharing new tools, tips and tricks. Which means actively looking out for
new and better ways and means.

After more or less 20 years, I've added <VisualStudio/> back to my toolkit as a code editor. Kudos. It's lean,
quick and feels like it belongs on my Mac.

Thanks to <SimpleSteph/> for the tip.
