import {ApacheIncubator, Kafka, LinkedIn} from "../../src/components/Tech"

During my old <ApacheDays/>, I spent many happy years helping out in the <ApacheIncubator/>.

My time there saw a lot of incredible projects work their way through the process. We evolved and refined the
graduation process by example. As a natural extension of my work on the legal affairs and in honing the release
approval process, I ended up spending most of my time checking provenance and talking through the legal side.
This gave me a broad understanding rather than the close relationship enjoyed by people wearing the mentor hat.

In 2011, towards the end of my service, <LinkedIn/> [open sourced](https://blog.linkedin.com/2011/01/11/open-source-linkedin-kafka) <Kafka/>
. By then, the process was not easy but was at least more predictable and better documented. Companies
like LinkedIn had by them realised that successful graduate required strategic backing and hard work especially on
the legal side but also by investing substantial engineering resources for several years.

In 2014, [Confluent](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141106180403-2945786-announcing-confluent-a-company-for-apache-kafka-and-realtime-data/)
was a smart move. Kafka was never core for LinkedIn. Better than investors fund the engineering efforts needed to
really push the project on.

Ten years on, it'll be interesting to see how the next phase plays out...
