I'm now a certified <AWS/> Professional.

Being a software engineer, that means taking the
[AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional](https://www.credly.com/badges/c8f92809-c0d1-447c-9659-8da4cbadbdb1) exam.

I found this one a real challenge. Inspired me to study automation hard across a wide range of services.

I am studying towards the second professional certification but will be dialing down the intensity. A fun break to
look forward to.
