Time for me to turn back again to AWS again, I think.

Originally, I'd planned to take CCOAK but a mix-up around payments introduced a delay into arranging the CCDAK exam.
I'm starting to feel really enthusiastic about getting back out there and creating something great once more.
CCOAK is interesting and I definitely intend to dive even deeper into Kafka but the time isn't right.

My mother was involved with a very serious road accident at the start of September. I took a break for a couple of
months to make sure she had the care and support needed to recover. Towards the end of the year, I'd been focussing
on GCP and Kafka.

Now it's time to get back to Kafka. I've signed up for an essentials course on Coursera to help get me back into the
swing.
