import {AWS}from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"
import {CCDAK, CCOAK} from "../../src/components/Tech"
import {Kafka} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Time for me to turn back again to <AWS/> again, I think.

---

Originally, I'd planned to take <CCOAK/> as well as <CCDAK/>. But after a mix-up around payments delay CCDAK,
I'm starting to feel really enthusiastic about getting back out there and creating something great once more.
CCOAK is interesting and I definitely intend to dive even deeper into <Kafka/> but the time doesn't feel quite right now.
