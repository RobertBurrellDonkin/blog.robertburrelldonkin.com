I've been spending a lot of <CPD/> time on <Coursera/> over the last few months. Let me take a moment for a little reflection.

Questions are often asked about the value of online courses. I think that the Jury remains out but any good answer
will be multifaceted.

Coursera courses seem to come in many flavours. Probably not as various as <Udemy/> and more carefully curated
but definitely flavours.

Some courses feel more academic, more like lectures. Others feel more like professional training, others more technical.

Be interesting to see how this market develops over time...
