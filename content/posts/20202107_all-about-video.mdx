Looking back, I've done a lot of remote collaboration, both open source and commercial. Video collaboration is
something all professionals have had to take more seriously in 2020. Soft video skills is an area likely to
be of increasing importance for software engineers going forward. It's going to take practice to really shine.

So video has been on my mind.

A couple of open source projects with recent releases are on my radar â€”
 * [Apache OpenMeeting](https://openmeetings.apache.org/index.html) 5.1.0
 * and [Kurento Media Server](https://www.kurento.org) 6.15.0

I enjoyed [Apache@Home](https://blogs.apache.org/conferences/entry/apachecon-home-2020-was-a). Yes, the platform
was basic but functional and I'm sure the experience will improve over time. All videos from ApacheCon@Home
now [available](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheApacheFoundation/).

Prefer your Apache news as video...?
