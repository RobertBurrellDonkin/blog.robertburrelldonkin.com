import {Docker, Minikube} from "../../src/components/Tech"

I've been running <Docker/> on this Mac using Docker Desktop. This has been convenient in some ways but keeps burning
CPU and pestering me about upgrades and licensing.

When Docker, Inc started moving away from free (as in beer) for
their [desktop bundle](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/) it was time for me to bite the
bullet and install a replacement.

I went for <Minikube/> and so far so good. Thanks to the following:

And I note a couple of interesting tools:
