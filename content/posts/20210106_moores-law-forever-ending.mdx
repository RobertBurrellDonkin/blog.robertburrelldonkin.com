When I started 25 years ago, software engineering was said to be coming to an end. Vendors promised that one day soon
their tools would be so fine that business people would no longer need software developers to realize their visions.

And 75 years or so since the first programmer wrote the first program, programmers are still being paid to deliver
business visions.

Just like Moore's law.

Forever ending but never ended...

The end of 2020 seems a good time to read and
reflect on the future of hardware.

Hardware leads software. In my happy Manchester days, academics were looking towards many core computing and
thinking about the software solutions that would be needed.

It's interesting to [read](https://easyperf.net/blog/2020/12/30/Computing-Industry-2020) predictions that hardware
shipped into the Internet of Things will be increasingly specialised systems-on-chip. Quite possibly.

But it all comes down to cost in the end. Designing SOC from scratch is expensive. A plug-and-play design approach
is more likely to lead to common standards and variations on an overarching architectural theme. Interesting and
important for engineers in that space but not as disruptive as the shift to many cores from a higher level software
perspective.
