import {LinkedIn} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Over the last decade, <LinkedIn/> has become an important tool to me.

(Or so I like to think. Hard to tell empirically.)

Social media platforms reward habitually. Algorithms favour regular users.

Regular users spend time and view pages. Making investors happy.

But invest too much time for too little reward, lose focus on your balance and fall.

Growing up in the broken ruins of Edwardian Liberalism, enlightened self-interest has always held a soft spot in my
heart and in my mind. In times like these, I hope people appreciate sharing opportunities and optimism. So that's
what I've been tried to do each day.
