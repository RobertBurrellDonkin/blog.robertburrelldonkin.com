import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

Returning to data engineering after a break, I've decided to shake things up. Hopefully, I'll say some more on this
later but I intend to make time for programme of continuing professional
development. <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/kafka'>Apache Kafka</GatsbyLink> is one of the three areas
I've been focussing on.

I've been working my way through the excellent *Apache Kafka Series* by [Stéphane Maarek](https://courses.datacumulus.com/).
More on this later.

Just a quick note to mark I completed
[Apache Kafka Series - Kafka Streams for Data Processing](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-c4879d58-696e-497d-b6c8-efda6725413e/)
and coded solutions for the exercises.
