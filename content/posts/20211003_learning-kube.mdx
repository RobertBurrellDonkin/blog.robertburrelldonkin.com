import {Kubernetes, Minikube, LinuxFoundation, AWS, EKS} from "../../src/components/Tech"

The last couple of years have been interesting ones on the world of microservices and containers. Back in 2019, there
were many contending approaches for orchestration.

Today, <Kubernetes/> is the clear winner.

To be honest, I'd be sticking a little clear. K8s has just a little bit of a reputation. Some technologies punish
superficial knowledge. Dive deep or not at all.

A few weeks ago, Docker finally pushed me into installing <Minikube/>. With a slightly heavy heart, I went out and
paid for the certification course and exam bundle from <LinuxFoundation/>.

Today, I sat down and started seriously studying the course and the architecture.

It's been a useful exercise for me.

And one that's given me an opportunity to reflect.

Maybe more later...
