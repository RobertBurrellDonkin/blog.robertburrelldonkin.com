Turns out that the [theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/) styling *[A Life Engineering Software](https://blog.robertburrelldonkin.com)* is
based on [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/). At first glance, I'm impressed.

I have some improvements in mind for this blog. Once I find some time...

I look forward to getting to know Theme UI a little better a little later...
