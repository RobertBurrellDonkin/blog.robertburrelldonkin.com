import {Kafka} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Time to ponder another idea that's just a little bit crazy...

Zero copy is the strategy that allows <Kafka/> brokers to perform so well under volume and load. The broker hands
off to the operating system the business of reading each batch of messages in from the socket and out onto memory
mapped disc.

Except when TLS is enabled, zero copy is turned off. The bytes are expensively decrypted then stored onto disc.

And encryption-in-flight without encryption-at-rest is a bit like Yorkshire tea without milk. So the data will
end up being expensively transformed in user space many times.

The cost is high. It boils down to TLS not being a particularly good match to this particular use case.

The solution that seems to be adopted out there is message-level encryption. By clients. Which isn't ideal.

Especially for small messages. Like compression, better to batch and encrypt the batch as a whole with a session key.
And though compression before encryption may leak some information, compressing salted batches would limit the
practicality of any crafted message attack on a high volume stream.

Like schema, probably worthwhile using a central registry for key distribution. Java keystores are fiddly and
secure distribution very definitely non-trivial especially so when you really want to rotate session keys regularly.

Doable, I'd say, but not in a weekend...
