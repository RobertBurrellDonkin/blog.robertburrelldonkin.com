When [Microsoft acquired GitHub](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) back
in 2018, I did wonder whether Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and his
“commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation” would ring hollow by 2020. How glad I am to admit
my fears were unfounded. So far, I think Microsoft has been a good custodian.

And kudos to Microsoft for introducing [unlimited private repos](https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/)
in 2019.

From time to time, an idea for a project strikes me. Often I'm unsure how far I'll want to take. Often novel or
experimental. Being able to start in private lowers the psychological bar and helps my public repos from being
overrun.
