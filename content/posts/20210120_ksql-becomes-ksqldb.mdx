import {Kafka, Confluent} from "../../src/components/Tech"

My journey deeper into <Kafka/> has showed me many interesting sites.

In this ages of reimagination, it's usually safe to assume that a change of name or logo is just a shallow rebranding,
a contemporary spin on the same old, same old.

Worth noting that KSQL -> ksqlDB signifies something more than a change of skin. KSQL may well have appeared to be
a well-intentioned attempt to make streaming more accessible to the old school DBA crowd.

Not so. ksqlDB is becoming the world's first mainstream streaming RDBMS. SQL didn't turn out the way it is by accident.
It's a tool that's well honed by decades of hard experience to a sharp edge.

And if - as seems not unlikely - the 2020s will see a renaissance for data engineering, ksqlDB leads this new
enlightenment.

No wonder why <Confluent/> is just a little bit of a darling of the markets at the mo.
