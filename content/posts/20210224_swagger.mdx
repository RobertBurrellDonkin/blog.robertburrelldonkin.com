import {Swagger, AWS} from "../../src/components/Tech"

A blast from my past.

We used <Swagger/> back in the Kiosk programme. Which had an interesting mix of microservices.

At that time, Swagger was growing in some interesting ways but not quite so essential as today.

The integration with <AWS/> is also now notable.
