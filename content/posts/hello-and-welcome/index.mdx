## Hello and Welcome!

To this, the first post on my third blog.

I'd like to share some material on the science, art and craft of software engineer here.

I've been helping to deliver interesting projects since the last days of the last millenium. My injury forced me to moderate the volume
but after decade of recovering, maybe it's overdue time to start dusting off the wings and thinking about flying again.
