import {Scala} from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"

import {VisualStudio, OpenSource, Microsoft, VB} from "../../src/components/Tech"

I've played around with worksheets a little before but I think I'm starting to understand the whys and the whens...

I've started building up <Scala/> again from first principles, taking a course to do so.

This journey shows how worksheets quite naturally arise from the tradition of empirical enquiry. Just with a new spin.

Worth noting that I found that <VisualStudio/> has better Scala worksheet support than the alternatives I tried.

Good for you, <Microsoft/>.
