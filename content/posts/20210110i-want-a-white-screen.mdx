In 2020, video went from being a rarity to being a professional necessity. My interview skills honed face-to-face
haven't really transferred. I'm bad at video interviews. I'm short of confidence. Which comes across.

It's been a challenge. I live in a listed terrace house. Major repairs were scheduled for March 2020 but could not be
completed. The long term impact of my injury limits my ability to take on manual labour. The property needs
redecorating but I either need to vacate or wait until the pandemic is over.

I've been using a grey backdrop to hide the damaged walls but I've grown to dislike the look and grey has not exactly gone
down well.

All the best engineering videos use bright white backdrops. That's the look I need going forward. I just need to
discover how to make that happen...
