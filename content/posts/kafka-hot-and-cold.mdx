Interesting post on [achieving high availability with stateful Kafka Streams applications](https://tech.transferwise.com/achieving-high-availability-with-kafka-streams/)

Got me thinking about hot and cold clusters. For mission critical event stream application, I've always found that
two duplicate clusters are worthwhile.

But what about the cost...? Isn't this twice as expensive...?

Well, the trick is to double up the cold clusters as disaster recovery and final testing.

Not appropriate for all use cases but a trick worth remembering...
