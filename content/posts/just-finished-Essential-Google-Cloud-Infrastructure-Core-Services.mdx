import { GCP,  } from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"

I'm focussing my continuing professional development on three areas. <GCP>Google Cloud Platform</GCP> is one.

Just a quick note that I
completed [Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/HTZNEQJVNTBN) today.

This is the third part of the *Cloud Engineering with Google Cloud Professional Certificate*.

I may leave the remaining content for a little while, until I feel ready to push for accredication.
