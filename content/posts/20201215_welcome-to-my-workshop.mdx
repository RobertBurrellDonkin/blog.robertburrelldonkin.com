A LinkedIn thread featuring [Vlad Mihalcea](https://vladmihalcea.com/blog/) and
[Matt Raible](https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/matt-raible/) set me thinking about blogging then and now. It
was all about the time and effort needed to create a high quality post.

And
yes, crafting the sort of great blog post that Matt and Vlad specialize in takes time.

One of the reasons I stopped blogging was the time commitment needed to keep up.

Now blogging is often seen as a shop window, as a way of advertising engineering mastery. Then, when I began blogging
all those years ago, it didn't feel that way. I wrote for myself and for my peers.

There's a joy in capturing the spirit of a moment in a post or in a code sketch. I've come to believe that there's
value too.

Just not the same value as the sort of finely crafted and considered post that might grace the pages of some other blogs.

I hope to recapture some of my original spirit, leave a door into my workshop ajar. I hope you'll forgive the mess...
