One of the things I'm looking for in a course is to understand why I'd be motivated to use this technology.
With an architects hat on, *why* means *when* — when is this approach more suitable than the alternatives.

Yes, KSQL is advertised as lowering the learning curve for people familiar with SQL. I'm sure it does.
The feel is very familiar from the days way back when.

That's not a good enough reason, though.

It's really that thanks to Kafka Streams, Kafka now easily supports a variety of distributed data store use cases.

And KSQL is a good match for relational distributed data stores.
