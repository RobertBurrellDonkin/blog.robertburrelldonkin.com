import {Java, IntelliJ, ProjectReactor} from "../../src/components/Tech"

I'm working on getting my fingers back up to speed with <Java/> and <IntelliJ/>.

I have a lot of reactive exercises lined up but have started with

https://github.com/reactor/lite-rx-api-hands-on

which is really great.

Sometimes I remember. Sometimes I need to consult the documentation. On occasion, I've need to consult the solution
in another branch to understand a nuance.

I've done reactive and streaming stuff before. But back then I kept hitting blockers (in both senses) to workaround.
Interesting but not ready for the prime time yet.

Reactive now feel ready.

Now <ProjectReactor/> is even better than when last I took a look. 

If you were wondering about dipping a toe into the world of reactive java: come on in - the water's lovely!
