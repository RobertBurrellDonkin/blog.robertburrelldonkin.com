Every time I look away, it seems there's something better, newer and shinier grows up over in JavaScriptLand.

This time, I've plucked [React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for that little project quizzing myself on Kafka.

At first glance, I like the shallow learning curve and only mild frustration. The documentation seems a little
idiosyncratic in a likeable and useful way.

So far, so good.
