import {Google, ReactLink} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Ah yes, good old [tab nabbing](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/256-targetblank---the-most-underestimated-vulnerability-ever/).

Bit of a classic. A specification mistake that's too big and wide for even <Google/> to be able to afford a [bounty](
https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/phishing-with-window-opener). A valuable lesson in humility.

Now every time anyone ```a```'s a ```href``` you need to add arcane incantations to keep the linking safe. Joy.

But being <ReactLink/>, there's a component for that. Probably lots but [react-external-link](https://github.com/acelaya/react-external-link)
is the one I've adopted.

And now my life is just a little bit better...
