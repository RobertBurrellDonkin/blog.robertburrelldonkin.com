import {Kafka} from "../../src/components/Tech"

After some twists and turns arranging the exam, I'm delighted to announce that I'm now a
[Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka](https://www.credential.net/f2ccede0-98d4-49ac-aac7-24fc5dc2a38f#gs.raj4b0).

For me, this was about more than professional certification but a motivation for a deep dive back into the <Kafka/>
ecosystem. I invested a lot of time learning, reading and researching. Feels like it's paid off in terms of the
knowledge and insights gained.

Reflecting back, I believe it's important to be clear about aims when you begin.

Had I just been interested in the certificate as (digital) paper then I could probably have focussed just on questions
likely to turn up. Instead, I took the time needed to research more widely and write up notes, tips and tricks.

That's not to say that this path is the right one for everyone or that I'll pick the longer path for all certificates.
Just that it felt right for me for this one at this time.
