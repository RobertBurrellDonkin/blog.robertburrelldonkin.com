Spring Boot ```2.3``` brought [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/). Which is quietly quite a big thing for microservices.

A couple of decades ago, back in my Apache Days, I remember the energy and effort around Jakarta when Maven brought
the idea of declarative tooling into focus in the Java world. Maybe I'll say more on
this later but Maven pushed software development up into the next gear.

Now I hope with buildpacks we may be about to see something similar.

No more ```Dockerfile``` to maintain. No more research on which particular base image is the best. Just add a plugin
and allow ```Spring Boot``` to take care of those details.

```
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>build-image</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

I'm all smiles.
