import {AWS, GCP, Kafka} from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"

My little break over the New Year allowed me to reflect and recalibrate.

The courses on <GCP/> have been great but now probably isn't the right time for me to push towards certification. Better to build on my
expertise in <AWS/> by pushing towards the certificates I have in mind.

But first, <Kafka/>

Wish me luck!
