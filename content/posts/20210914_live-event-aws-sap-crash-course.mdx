I  always seem to get a lot out of Chad Smith's material. Today and yesterday it's
"AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional Crash Course" for me.

Chad is strong on talking around real life scenarios and relating them into the questions set in the certification
exams. I find it helps to bring it all together.

Turning my life around after the injury taught me many lessons. One is to make the most of the time you have.
I often look for ways to combine activities. I now have an indoor cycling setup that allow me to cycle along
to material like a live event.

Personally, I find doing something helps me to focus on the material. Some people knit. I cycle.
