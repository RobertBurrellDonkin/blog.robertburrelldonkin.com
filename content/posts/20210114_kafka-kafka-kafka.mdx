import {Kafka} from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"
import {Confluent} from "../../src/components/Tech"

My deep dive into <Kafka/> has begun. I hope to resurface with professional certification from <Confluent/> .

Means quite a lot to me. Reasonable accommodation at test centers has been a major barrier for me in the past.

And the whole not being able to write thing has blocked academic ambitions.

But there's a silver lining to each cloud, if only you look hard and long enough. For me, it's the availability of remote
proctoring which has opened opportunities to gain certifications.

Wish me luck.
