For many years before the injury, I maintained two blogs.

The first I started when everyone at Apache was getting into blogging. It featured my life outside work especially
open source and free software. The dark works were written on a light background on a platform favoured by the Java
world. Now, the platform and blog are just history in the archives of the internet.

The second began later as a place to cover more about my professional life with a focus on topics agile and lean.
It was on a platform enriched with media. The theme I picked out was light words on dark which showed off the
media I liked to try to include with each post. For a while whilst I had very little typing after the injury, I drew
(from the elbow) and posted the results. I think I was saying to all my friends - I might be down but I'm still fighting.

This is my third blog. It begins around a decade after the other blogs came to their nature ends.

Today, going back and triaging the drafts has shown me how little content I've created on matters agile and lean.

Perhaps it's that dark words on light influences my subconscious.

On reflection, at a deeper level, over the last decade as specialists and business schools have studied deeply the
agile and lean techniques and methods pioneered by practitioners in the 90s and 00s, I started to leave agile and lean
to the people who've made it their vocation.

And since my injury, I've done plenty of mentoring but moved away from team leadership to pure engineering. Having
been involved with team building and leadership, I appreciate that leaders needs space. As a permanent engineer, I tried
to be a supportive team member.

And when I moved into contract engineering, there's a distance needed and a clarity.
