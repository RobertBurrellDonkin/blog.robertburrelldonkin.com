Songs used to sing "Cut your hair and get a job"...

Fast forward into the 2020s. And now that line asks to be reimagined as "Update LinkedIn ".

And yes - how to present oneself on LinkedIn feels to me a lot like haircuts back in the BritPop days.

Some people love to follow fashion. Others stick to a classic formula.

Maybe I'll end up falling into the muddled middle, trying hard to renew my self-respect and retain my authenticity but
without that polished style that comes spending quality time with the platform.

Still, like a haircut, there's only so long you can leave it.

So I've been pruning and adding skills and courses. Out with my maths degree courses. Out with skills that are missing
from the algorithm. Give the new skill assessment a little bit of a whirl.

Any better...?

Hard to say - but like that haircut at the start, it's more about making the effort.

I'm inclined towards the data-driven school of thought. LinkedIn reports a hit rate of 50 which is fine for now.
Social algorithms reward incremental improvement and gradual engagement. I have a (rather long) list of small
improvement tasks for LinkedIn but I'll pick them up a little each day. Then see how they do.
