The <Scala/> course brings back memories of <a href='https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/'>Miranda</a>. Not
some mysterious functional female but a programming language. Follow that link to read more...

At the start of the 90s, I enjoyed many happy years studying <Maths>maths</Maths> at <Warwick>Warwick</Warwick>,
taking the long walk past the lakes up Gibbet Hill to the original maths building.

Warwick was one of the unis founded in the 60s, a postwar <PlateGlassUni/> poster child. Built in countryside
on the edge of Coventry, an ancient city bombed flat by the Nazis and never restored to its past glories. Back then,
these institutions represented a break with the class system and its divisions. Open admission systems based on
attainment. Innovative course structures.

And the spirit of learning from institutions overseas

One of features I loved most was the variety and flexibility that structure offered. A veritable smorgasbord.
Closer to the US style of major and minor without losing that English flavour. From dozens of departments.
Including CompSci.

Which allowed me to indulge myself by taking functional programming featuring Miranda.

The way I remember it, the lecturer pronounced that too many people wrongly claimed that functional languages were
unsuitable for IO. So our assessed assignment was to program a maze game. I relished this challenge and ended up doing
well.

Structure procedural programming proved to hold no interest for me, as the course in Pascal proved.

But functional programming agreed with me then. I find it still does now.
