import {KafkaStreams} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Sometimes it's good to dream crazy ideas

Thinking on the immature fault tolerance vision around interactive queries in <KafkaStreams/>, I was pondering
using Akka for state stores. Yes a crazy idea and fuses different paradigms.

But Akka has a strong architecture for distributing state. I've found Akka useful before, especially prototyping,
for mixing in a little bit of state into an event pipeline...

Probably just a crazy idea but sometimes it's good to dream
