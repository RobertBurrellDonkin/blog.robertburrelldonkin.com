I'm definitely not the first to say so, and doubt I'll be the last, but I think it bears repeating that 2021 looks
like being a year of churn, of beginnings and as well as ending.

From an engineering perspective, success means being able to take opportunities as they become available. Which mean
positioning.

For people clinging on to a role that they no longer love, it's time to move to a project that you're able to
embrace enthusiastically with all your heart.

For people who've been taking a bit of a break, it's time to get back up to speed again.
