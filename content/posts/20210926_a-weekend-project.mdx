import {Android, Kotlin, Java, Ionic, ReactLink, Google, SpringBoot, Akka, Kafka} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Been a while since I've done a little programme project over the weekend. A long while. Another little step
towards coming back.

I learnt <Android/> in pursuit of a IoT proof-of-concept for a startup back at the start of 2020. After
trying <Ionic/> and <ReactLink/>, I found that to upload the data volumes with the required efficiency, latency and
concurrency, I needed to turn native. For the data flow
over to the incredible Unity stuff done by some amazing wizards in Minsk, I used my old favourites <Kafka/>
and <SpringBoot/> microservices with some <Akka/> in the mix managing the data outflow to clients.

Nothing as complex but brings back happier memories.

Coming back again after my long layoff, it's a pleasure to start developing a little side-project for fun again.
