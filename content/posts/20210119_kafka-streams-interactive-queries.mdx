import {KafkaConnect, Kafka, KafkaStreams, ksqlDB} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Before starting this deep dive into <Kafka/>, I didn't really get <KafkaStreams/> or why engineers in the microservice
space should be excited about it...

Kafka Streams fits really well into the microservice paradigm. Unlike (say) <KafkaConnect/> there are no
extra monoliths to maintain. Just microservices running streams.

Interactive queries for streams strike me as an interesting idea but don't yet feel entirely finished. The general
idea is to build a stateful topology then query the state stores for the latest analysis. Sounds workable but the
fault tolerance fiddly to maintain for the moment.

I'll be interested to follow this approach as it matures...
