Introspection does not always come easily to me but reflection is often rewarding in the end, I find. This seems like a good
time to set down a little more on whys and wherefors, the long and the short of the matter.

Looking ahead, 2020 is set to be one of those years which act as markers, milestones not just in my journey
but also in the paths of billions across this blue-green world. Going forward, I see professional certificates becoming
more important within professional software engineering. I need to know about them. Which means trying some out.

And 2020 surprised me, leaving me with a longer gap than I'd wish. In the short term, I not only need to get up to
speed but be seen to have got back up to speed.

And many technologies have gone some interesting places.

It's a balancing act. I really need to put myself in a position to be able to take on some new projects early 2021
but first, I plan to dive deeper into what I've been missing...
