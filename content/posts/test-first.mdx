import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

A couple of days ago, I <GatsbyLink to='/just-finished-kafka-streams'>finished</GatsbyLink> working through the course
on [Kafka Streams](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-c4879d58-696e-497d-b6c8-efda6725413e/) by [Stéphane Maarek](https://courses.datacumulus.com/).

Right at the end came the section on test automation tooling. Which made me realise how much I missed being able to
drive the earlier development by tests.

In turn, this made me reflect on my long-standing and productive
relationship with [Test First](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html). In many ways test first taught
me how to intentionally engineer a solution.

I first adopted test driven development (then test first) during my
early <GatsbyLink to='/memberships/asf'>Apache Days</GatsbyLink>. It made me think hard about what I intended the
solution to do and how I intended it to behave. Engineering, I think, is mostly about intention. Be clear about the
solution you intend to develop. Learn ways and means to create what you intend.

I often like to say that adoption of automated tests was the key factor in the success of Apache Jakarta and all that
sprung from it. And I still think that's true enough.

Which makes 2020 near enough a 20th anniversary for my relationship with test first. If only I wasn't locked down, I'd
buy dinner...

Automation was a passion of mine before my injury.

Looking back, I've been fortunate enough to be able to help more than a few developers along their journeys.

And I find I still have more I'd like to say but only when I have the time to do justice to the subject...
