# Welcome

To my third blog *A Life Engineering Software*.

I hope you might find some items of some interest.

## The Source
The source for my third blog *A Life Engineering Software* is found
[here](https://github.com/RobertBurrellDonkin/blog.robertburrelldonkin.com).

## The Technology

This site is delivered continuously through a pipeline.

 * I develop content using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
 * I commit the content as source and push to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
 * [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
   * picks up the hook,
   * uses Gatsby to generate static content and
   * deploys this static content to a global CDN

All works really smoothly now. All free as in beer or free as in freedom. Give it a go.

## The Back Story

Back when the blogging was new, *Wierdest Undreampt Use Case* was my first blog.

Then I added *It's Tech Up North* on [Blogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)) -
a richer experience with more media.

After the injury in 2010 in order to complete the journey back to software engineering, blogging was one of those
things I needed to leave behind.

This is (still) 2020. I'm returning once more to data engineering after a bit of a career break. And feeling strong
enough to pick up the blogging again.

Where *Wierdest Undreampt Use Case* was edgy, as the name suggests I hope that *A Life Engineering Software* turns out
to be more measured and moderate. I think I'm about ready for a bit more of that in my life as well as my blog.

Where *It's Tech Up North* was all about agile and lean, as the name suggests I hope that *A Life Engineering Software*
covers more engineering and more architecture. As the agile and lean movements have matured,
the batton has been handed onto professionals who have made methods study their specialism.
