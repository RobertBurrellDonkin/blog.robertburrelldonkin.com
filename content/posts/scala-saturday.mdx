import {GCP, Scala, CPD} from "../../src/components/LifelongLearning"
import {WHUS} from "../../src/components/Projects"

We live in interesting times. Our travails each particularly personal.

Mine revolve around being trapped by myself. Life loses shape and structure. Good intentions drift.

Time to separate weekdays from weekends.

Ever since my time in the great New Jersey launch team for <WHUS/>, gaining a comprehensive understanding of <Scala/>
has been a quiet ambition. So I'm going to try Scala at the weekends on the classic course.

And there's a certificate to add to my <CPD/> roadmap.

And <GCP/>...? Maybe I'll try to fit in an hour each evening before bed.
