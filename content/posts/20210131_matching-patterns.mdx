import {Manchester, Warwick} from "../../src/components/Education"

To take a break at weekends during endless lockdown, I signed up for the famous École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
functional programming specialization over at Coursera. I've delivered contracts featuring Akka where Scala has been
in the mix but I've never really sat down and learnt the language from scratch.

I'm glad I did.

Being an academic (rather than professional or vocational) course, the focus begins with qualities languages might
enjoy. The programming assignments are quite substantial and well-chosen too but definitely enjoy an academic flavour.
This is a pleasant contrast to the very vocational introduction I had to Scala previously.

Not only has this plugged many gaps but has also linked into academic material I studied during the masters
at <Manchester>Manchester</Manchester> and my time at <Warwick>Warwick</Warwick>.

It's also made me see the reason why some language features are so useful. This weekend,
it was [pattern matching](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html).
