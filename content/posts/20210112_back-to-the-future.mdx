Now that solutions with hundreds of microservices are not uncommon, *observability* has now become quite a *big thing*.

It's sometimes said to CompSci students that the final code delivered should always be free of debugging statements.

Back in my Apache Days, before great Java IDEs and debuggers, I spent a lot of time coding using plain text editors
and using extra print statements to debug.

For open source libraries, every user pays the price for logging. As a library author, I think the best practice is to
include only logging statements that contribution to comprehension.

But for microservices, I preach from another Gospel. Always leave in logging statements after debugging but turn them
down to ```trace``` or ```debug```.

But why...?

Libraries are called within the same process. Latency is low. Any library user who needs more detailed logging has the
option to fork - or use aspect oriented programming. But users who need high performance may not be able to live
with the additional overhead of logging in the golden path.

Microservices are called over the network. In relative terms, unused logging statements are orders of magnitude
quicker than even the quickest network operation. The performance tradeoff is quite different in this case.

And for microservices, observability is so critical for reliable operation.
