Continuing professional development is something I've start to take more seriously.
Today, I'm booked onto a [O'Reilly Live Event](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/live-events.html) -
*Scalable Reactive Programming with Java*.

O'Reilly gave me a great deal to get me on their platform in its early days. And unlike many corporations who punish
loyalty, I continue to be rewarded with a good price for their platform.

Live Events were new to me this year, though I think they've been around for a while. Now I've attended seven
I'm starting to appreciate just how good this format is at keeping me up to date.
