When Maven came together, adopting the declarative paradigm for build systems seemed fresh and new.

To anyone who didn't appreciate how much effort Maven took, it might come as a surprise that containers tools are still
quite procedural.

Dockerfiles are imperative.

Which is fine (and the most appropriate approach) when tooling is young and
evolving fast. Procedural tooling allows any decent developer will find a way to quickly solve a novel problem.

Its taken time for declarative tools to start arriving but with [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) arriving into
production with support from (for example) Spring Boot, I think the wait is coming to an end.
