I stumbled upon <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/'>Amazon Corretto</a>
whilst <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/aws'>brushing up on AWS</GatsbyLink>. Quietly quite a big thing in my
Java world.

## But Why...?

**Amazon Corretto** is a curated, supported no-cost multiplatform distribution covering the major long term support
versions.

To understand where this fits into the jigsaw of future Java, you need to reminisce a little...

## Just A Little Bit Of History

Java was on bit of a sticky wicket for a few years in the mid 00s. There were questions about Oracle's custodianship.
Oracle started to restrict access to older versions. Adopt JDK and OpenJDK were struggled to get into their stride.

From a business perspective, it's unsurprising that Oracle needed to get out of the expensive business of supporting
old versions for nothing.

But, from a community-health perspective it's important that another business stepped up.

Thanks to Amazon that they did.
