JavaScript was released in December 1995.

There are several contenders for the [birth date](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch04.html) but I'm going to
back [Matt Riable](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/04/25-years-javascript-java) and pick December 4th.

JavaScript lies towards the loosely typed end of the language spectrum.

One perspective on typing is that essentially, it's just a basic form of test driven development. As the art and science
of test automation has advanced over the last 25 years, this advantage has eroded.

Smart programming assistance has become more important over this time. Strong typing assists code analysis.
Which aids smart tooling. I'll be interested to see how far this advantage erodes over the next decade.

Almost all mainstream programming languages today ship with lots of core libraries. JavaScript is an outlier.

Java's wealth turned out to be the community of open source libraries that grew around it. JavaScript took this to
another level.

Odd as it might sound today but most companies were once most hesitant about open source. Java could not have
mainstreamed without a comprehensive standard library engineered to a high standard by Sun. But this large corpus limits
adoption beyond servers.

JavaScript stepped up. And up. And up.

Thanks to data science and serverless functions, Python is the latest hottest language. Python now ships with ever more
comprehensive standard libraries. Be interesting to see how Python vs JavaScript plays out over the next decade.

*Best Wishes, JavaScript, and Good Luck for your next quarter century!*
