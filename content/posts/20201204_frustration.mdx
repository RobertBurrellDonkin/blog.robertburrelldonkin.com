Security seems simple from a distance but up close, there are lots of details.

A website should never store your password. Use good salt and store a secure hash.

And use JavaScript to salt and hash on the client to avoid leakage into logs and so on in the back end.

Websites that do not allow rich, complex passwords are almost certainly not coding by engineers without the will and
capacity to take security seriously. If you're a frustrated engineer looking to make the case for professional
quality code, why not just point key stakeholders to the vast fines that may now punish those companies who ignore good
practice...?
