[Miro](https://miro.com/) is a virtual whiteboard. Lots of people love it. Many people do incredible things using it.

I had reasons to try Miro out last weekend. I found the learning curve steep. And even a decade after the injury,
I need to take particular care with user interfaces that rely on mouse activity or gestures.

And my use case – event driven architectural diagrams – wasn't directly supported out of the box.

Yesterday, I decided to persevere. I watched some videos. Played around. Tried some other use cases.

And it's grown on me.
