import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

Blogging platforms have often frustrated me in the past. Especially limitations.

One reason I turned to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is the wealth of open source
components both closely coupled and within the wider [React](https://reactjs.org/) ecosystem.

I'm glad I did. It's really easy to enrich content.

For example, I wanted to embed a tweet
in a <GatsbyLink to='/well-done-prevayl'>recent post</GatsbyLink>. Just add the dependency
then ``import`` and it just worked.

I like quick wins :-)

That reminds me about emoji...
