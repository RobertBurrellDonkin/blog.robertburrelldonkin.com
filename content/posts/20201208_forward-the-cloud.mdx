After a break, I plan to return to data engineering.


Like so many other engineers, my journey led me

```on premises``` ➞ ```data centers``` ➞ ```private cloud``` ➞ ```public cloud```

(The future's hybrid and it's here today)

At the start of 2020, I had a short spell at a start up called Prevayl. Well Done everyone

This time was the first where I had some responsible for configuring and securing AWS. Previously,
I'd always had the luxury of amazing DevOps teams.

My eyes were opened. So much has come together in the public cloud over the last couple of years.

Back during my <GatsbyLink to='/memberships/asf'>Apache Days</GatsbyLink> back in the 00s,
at those three <GatsbyLink to='/memberships/asf/meetups'>ApacheCons</GatsbyLink> at The Mövenpick Hotel in Amsterdam,
I listened to hopes and dreams. Fifteen years later, after so many people
worked so hard, it is grand to see this approach mainstreaming.

I promised myself never to regret opportunities lost
through injury. I do like to think that I'd have helped out had I been more able.

Which is why <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/aws'>AWS</GatsbyLink>
and <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/gcp'>GCP</GatsbyLink>
are two areas of focus within my continuing professional development.

More on this later...
