[Sam Newman](https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices_2nd_edition/)

An interesting definition.

As a professional engineer, even back in the 00s most (or maybe even all, I forget) of the solutions I helped to deliver
were built up from several independent deployable units. Thanks to my Apache experiences, I usually gravitated towards
helping out on the deployment automation side.

So microservices were never as much a conceptual leap as a natural progression.

Where Sam and his peers made a key contribution, I think, was by explaining so clearly to the world why microservices
were such a useful architectural paradigm for complex large scale
systems.
