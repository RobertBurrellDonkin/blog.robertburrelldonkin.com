import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

I first started getting into open source in the last years of the last millenium. At that time, my day job was developing
enterprise HR software for markets overseas in Visual Basic. In my spare time, I played cricket, learned Java and
tinkered with various flavours of *nix.

During the 00s,
contributing to the <GatsbyLink to='/memberships/asf'>Apache Software Foundation</GatsbyLink> was a guiding passion.
I was elected a [Member](https://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html).

Then in 2010 came my injury. My road to recovering use of my hands has been long struggle. And most of the
things I loved in the old days had to be cut out of my life. Including Apache.

2020 has been another difficult year in so many ways for myself as well as so many others. On a personal level, it
also contains some significant personal milestones. Such as relearning to drive a car
(but sadly not getting back on two wheels).

And returning to Apache. At least a little.

There's more to do (before I feel ready to even think about committing code) but I've taken the steps needed to
restore access to my [account](https://home.apache.org/~rdonkin/).

Little steps add up. Or so I've found.
