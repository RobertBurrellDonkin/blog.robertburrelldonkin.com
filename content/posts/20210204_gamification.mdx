2021 is looking like the year that *gamification* is coming of age. Bit like Generation G.

Back in the 70s and 80s, education was assessed by final exams right at the end.

The model used by online platforms like Coursera is close to being the opposite of that model. You can try and retry
quizzes and exercises as you like. All you lose is your own time. Close to a gaming model.

And like gaming, to get the most out of your time you need to set a goal and stick to it.

Final exams assess your ability on the day. These courses assess your will.

This model is great for building a certain sort of confidence. Learners are able to see themselves improve and
overcome challenges. That hard work pays off.

This sort of confidence can be brittle. Life sometimes offers no second chances. There's an additional trap for
professional engineers. Mistakes are expensive.

Which is where accreditation comes in, I think. Passing an exam gives confidence that the knowledge is consolidated,
that when you need to get it right first time you will.
