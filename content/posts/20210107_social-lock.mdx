import {LinkedInProfile} from "../../src/components/Myself"
import {LinkedIn, Microsoft} from "../../src/components/Tech"

I maintain quite a complete <LinkedInProfile/> on <LinkedIn/>. Which means I invest in LinkedIn.

Everyone who creates content for social media vests a stake in the future of that platform. Yet, few social media
platforms come with strong assurances about your investment.

2020 may well mark a watershed, a turning point for many matters. Including social media.

One day, I expect legislatures will regulate. Most likely, after a scandal or two first.

In these times, it's worth hedging any bet.

I feel quite relaxed about LinkedIn under the custodianship of <Microsoft/>. LinkedIn makes exporting easy.
Which reassures me and encourages me to keep investing my content.
