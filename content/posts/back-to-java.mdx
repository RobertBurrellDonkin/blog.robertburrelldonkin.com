The NJ launch for William Hill Global was a personal high watermark. I was part of the small team that ported the
backend microservices. It's great to see that subsequent growth in the US led to the
[Â£2.9Bn takeover](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/markets-insights/investing-ideas/shares/william-hill-playing-winning-hand-us/).

In many ways, I think this was a textbook use of resources. William Hill Global assembled and isolated
an amazingly talented and dedicated set of teams blending key in-house experts with heavy hitting contractors then
transferring their knowledge to new employees.

After the launch, I was asked back for a couple of short contacts. First a POC for the strategic solution then to
engineer a microservice within the strategic solution. Felt a bit like those encores in the days of my musical youth.

But where do you go from that...?

I ended up taking a break afterwards. There were personal reasons, of course, but I also felt uncertain about the future
of Java under Oracle. I spent more time on JavaScript, Ruby and Python. I considered going full time React.

But my path led me back again to Java.

Coming back fresh to Java during the summer of 2020, I found that Oracle and OpenJDK have done a fine job. And yes,
the new rolling release pattern is working really well. We're seeing the new language features that are needed to
keep Java competitive.

And I rediscovered my passion and enthusiasm.

Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2 are awesome. Reactive streams have matured well.

It's time that I rolled up my sleeves and get involved with another great project.
