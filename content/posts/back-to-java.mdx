The NJ launch for William Hill Global was a high point for me. It's great to see that the US business is now worth
over $2Bn.

I needed to regain passion and enthsuaism. I felt I need to be convinced that Orcale would become a good custodian for
Java. So I've done presonal projects in other and platforms.

I started coming back to Java during the summer 2020 and started to rediscover my passion and enthusiasm. Oracle
has done a fine job in revigirating the ecology. The release pattern is really great. It really builds confidence thta
Java is going to be around for at least the next decade.

I believe that Oracle and the OpenJDK community are doing well to walk that fine line, bringing in the new language features
needed to keep Java competitive.

Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2 are awesome. Again, kudos.

Return to software engineering allowed me to reflect.

My two months at Prevayl gave me a window into how far the cloud platforms had come in this time.

Public Cloud AWS and GCP
Spring and <GatsbyLink to='/lifelong-learning/kafka'>Apache Kafka</GatsbyLink>

I started gravitating in this direct a while ago. I'd consider but I need some reasonable accommodation to type safely.

Should probably talk about my injury -> link to a page, I expect -> that then links to universities, I expect but not
yet

What I am trying to say...?

Being an autodidact with a proven track record of getting up to speed with new technologies quickly gives me confidence
in my ability to learn. The world changes. Professions mature. My grandfather Charlie Mittens might have learnt about
electrical engineering by building early power stations and grids but there came a time when innovation matured into
professionalism.

I grew up in the post-industrial North of England. Life expectancy was closer to forty than forty-five. I expect it's
hard to image now but Bradford was all ruins and rubble then. Fortunately, my facility with number allowed me to
win places on a couple of Maths degrees.
