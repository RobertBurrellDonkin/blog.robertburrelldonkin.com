low entropy solutions

mutliple ways unlock same key

really like the idea of using a session key to encrypt documents within an archive then storing the key
with the archive encrypted using slots just like

Storage at rest and in flight is the minimum.

But there are times when really data payloads should remain encrypted with only the meta data being used to

Let's pick an internet of things example. A bunch of data from . For most legs, getting the data to the right processors

But securely distributing a single session key is not trivial.

How could something like slots work...?

Well, if a service is allowed to process payload then the session key would already be encrypted with the service
public key. The service would then use its private key. Decentralised distribution.

Should a key for service become compromised or de

In my opinion, this is a better solution than simple deletion to flexible privacy. Delete all the slots not managed
by the user and the data becomes unreadable.
