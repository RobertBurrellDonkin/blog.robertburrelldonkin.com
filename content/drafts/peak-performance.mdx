Most sports use the hands. After my injury rationed my use, I discovered running.

Like martial arts, I found running taught me to be a better engineer.

And racing has lessons for exam preparation. Software is heading into a phase where certifications are becoming
more important. I thought I'd share some of those lessons.

All racing is competitive. But for almost all runners, you compete together against the roads, trails, sands or fells.

Sports science has proven coaching advice most wise. To achieve peak performance on the day, organise your training
to maximise intensity.

For a half marathon, my favourite distance, peak training intensity might come two or three weeks before.

I've found it's the same with exams. Comes in phases. With the last.
