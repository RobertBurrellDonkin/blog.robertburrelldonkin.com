I'm coming back ...? My headline says so...

Everyone seems to have to overcome their own unique challenges since the pandemic began. As have I. I'm sure we'll all have a laugh together in some distant time when it's all over but not today.

Let's instead talk about my professional life circa 2021 and in general and certification in particular. Now feels like a good time to look back a little at the certs I've passed this year:

AWS Certified Security - Specialty (SCS)
AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional (DOP)
AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA)
AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA)
AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate (SOA)

Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka (CCDAK)
