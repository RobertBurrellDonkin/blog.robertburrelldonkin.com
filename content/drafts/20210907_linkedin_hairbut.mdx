Songs used to sing "Cut your hair and get a job"...

Fast forward into the 2020s. Now that lines needs to be reimagined as "Update LinkedIn ".

And yes - how to present yourself only LinkedIn feels a lot like haircuts back in the BritPop days.

Some people love to follow fashion. Others stick to a classic formula.

Maybe I end up falling into the muddled middle, trying hard to renew my self-respect and retain my authenticity.

Still, like a haircut, there's only so long you can leave it.

So I've been pruning and adding skills and courses. Out with my maths degree courses. Out with skills that are missing
from the algorithm. Give the new skill assessment a little bit of a whirl.

Any better...?

Hard to say - but like that haircut at the start, it's more about making the effort.

I'm inclined towards being data-driven. LinkedIn reports a hit rate of 50 which is fine for now. Social algorithms
reward incremental improvement and gradual engagement. I have a (rather long) list of small improvement tasks for
LinkedIn but I'll pick them up a little each day.
