Songs used to sing "Cut your hair and get a job"...
Fast forward into the 2020s and updating LinkedIn feels a little like that to me.

Some people love to follow fashion. Others stick to a classic formula.

Not sure where I fall within that spectrum... most likely just doing to enough to preserve my self-respect.

I've been pruning and adding skills and courses. Out with my maths degree courses. Out with skills that are missing from the algorithm. Give the new skills assessment a little bit of a whirl.

Any better...? Hard to say - but like that haircut at the start, it's more about making a little bit of an effort.
