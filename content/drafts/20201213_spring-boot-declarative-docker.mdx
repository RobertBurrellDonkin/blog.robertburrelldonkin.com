After the break, it's been great to see how have `Spring` and `Spring Boot` have travelled in interesting directions.

Like many software engineers, the containerization has solved so many long term problems. But – as often seems to
happen – it's taken a while for really great tooling to arrive.

When Maven came together, adopting the declarative paradigm for build systems seemed fresh and new.

But delivering on the promise of declarative tooling turned out to take a **lot** of effort. So many contributors
in so many different projects. And even then, it took a couple of major versions before Maven became really great.

So it wasn't a surprise that though containerization was almost always awesome, the tool was fiddly.

And its take time for declarative tools to start arriving.

Hopefully, I'll have more to say about some of the strategic advantages of declarative tooling some other time but
today, I'll try not to get too distracted.

Dockerfiles are procedural. Which is fine and absolutely the most appropriate approach when tooling is young and
evolving fast. With procedural tooling, any decent developer will find a way to quickly solve a problem. Improving
declarative involved far more investment coming up with a reasonably general solution to that particular problem.

But the patterns . Optimization requires standard patterning.

So its great that Spring Boot now has

Spring Boot 2.3
