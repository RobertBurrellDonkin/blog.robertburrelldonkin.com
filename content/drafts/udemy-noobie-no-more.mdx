Online learning came of age in 2020. For personal reasons, I'm fashionably late to the party but let me share
a few early lessons on lessons.

I prefer to dive in. This is the year for heavy discounts. So I bought lots. I had already aims in mind for
the next stage of my continuing professional development. Tactics should adhere into strategy. So the courses
fit into a broader programme.

I hope to have more to say about Coursera some other time but I've spent a lot of time on Udemy. So that's today's
topic.

Udemy has a more flexible model than Coursera (say). It fits a wider range of use cases. Which is great.

But as a student, I've found that you need to bring clarity about intentions.

A good example was

And then there's the certificate.

For software engineers, a portfolio is important. I've read that udemy exercises are really good ways to build a
portfolio. I intend to try.

But later. I prefer to use courses to learn, to try new approaches. If you really want to build a

Pass the course first then come back and write up your own solutions.

I'm rather taken by the idea of Kata and need to build my video skills. I'm tempted to record these as live kata.

I've always been able to pick up new technologies swiftly and surely. There's a definite knack. Moreover, I was one of
