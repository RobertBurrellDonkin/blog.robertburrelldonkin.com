Gatsby

In this age of globaly distributed content networks, pushing content close to your readers improves performance.

This is an engineering blog so let's qualify. A CDN caches content across the world and serves it from the closest cache.

 * The trip from your read to the closet cache is shorter, **reducing latency**.
 * Content served from a cache is not read from a central store, **reduce load** on that store.
 * Static content is retrieved without processing, **reduce load**.

This performance improvement enables cost reductions allowing static content to be served *gratis* by many vendors.

Okay. Bit of rush but I'd like to talk about a more subtle quality. In this new age, poor cybersecurity can lead to
real costs for businesses.

# Security

The internet is a hostile place. Running a data store and a server out in the wild is a risk.

It's about the surface area you need to secure. The data stores and processors used to serve content are complex,
requiring specialist knowledge to secure and provide pathways for attackers to bypass the corporate security
parimeter.

In any case, content development and creators need to be secured but now that technologies like Gatsby allow you to
isolation these activities from content .

# A Note on History

Static site generators have been around forever. I may even have contributed a little to a few back in my Apache days.
In the early days of the web, processing power was expensive.

The cloud changes everything and changed the balance of advantage between static and dynamic solutions.
