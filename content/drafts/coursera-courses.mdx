2021 looks like the year that ```gamification``` finally came of age.

I never really grokked the quizes. You get a thumbleful of tries before being blocked.

Zen of coursera technical courses. This is the first course where I couldn't simple watch the videos and use my
existing knowledge to get every question correct. Perhaps with a retry.

This course needs another strategy

Go through and see what can be passed at the first try in each week before circuling back around to focus on
reading more deeply on any areas that you don't know well.

Means I'll switch to using a video course to relax and wind down or to take a break.
