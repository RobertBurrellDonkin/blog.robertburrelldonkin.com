import {Android, Google} from "../../src/components/Spring"


I'm setting aside most of next week to get my fingers back up to speed with <Spring/>

Kata are one of my tricks. I've been cycling along to a few courses.

I've been drawing up a list of exercises. I need to be able and intensively practice a lot in a short time.

It's no good thinking about what I'm going to do. I need to be able to have a list of exercises then working through.

So I've been devising a programme.

Once I'm feeling confident, I'll move onto talking through on video whilst I do them. This is a really great way
to practice for microservices interviews.

Some pair programming exercises involve actually pairing up. Others are more like delivering a running commentary.
I've found video interviews difficult since I now longer have the non-verbal ques I need to work out whether the interview
expected more interaction.

This has been useful on several levels.

It's got me thinking back on the days when I did microservices.
