Yes, I'm missing Kube from my CV.

I've delivered a lot of dockerized microservices but the downstream deployments have been handled by DevOps.

Kube certification is tough. And managing Kube is notoriously difficult. To be honest, I'd rather avoid that.

But there are small sets I should probably take.

Minikube to replace Docker Desktop, I expect.

And take a course on EKS.

And maybe line up a Kube course on Cousera at some point.

Kube feels like the nth orchestration framework I've needed to pick up. Today, I'm feeling hard to get myself motivated.

Let's start with installing minikube and shooting Docker. Next week, of course. Next week.
