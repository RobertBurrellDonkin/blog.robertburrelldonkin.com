Do We Software Engineers Need to Raise the Bar...?


I wonder whether history will look back on the 2020s as the decade where software engineers finally grew up. Back in the late 90s, we were young and planted the seeds that grew into the internet, free and open source, and agile methods. In the 00s, we grew into automation, big data and the cloud. We surfed the waves through the 10s and grew fat on the profits.

But now it's the 20s. Businesses should be asked - why did we pay software engineers so much for so long for systems that can be so easily owned by kids based overseas...?

Making hiring decision based on toy coding problems, telling candidates just to ignore security and hack away sounded cool in 2019. Two years later, I think this starts to sound like wilful negligence.

Back in the 80s and 90s serious questions raised by the previous generation of engineers led to all the good fruits we enjoyed in the 10s. Having eaten those fruits, maybe it's time we thought a bit more about our legacy too.

When considering candidates and promotions, I argue that we need to consider more carefully the qualities we seek to assess and how best to undertake those assessments.

The one hour technical interview is a fine medium for assessing whether the candidate is someone your team could work with but it's not enough. We need to think serious about raising the bar.

2021 has turned into a little bit of a personal oddesy for me.

AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA)

AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA)

AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate (SOA)

AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional (DOP)

AWS Certified Security - Specialty (SCS)

I think AWSx5 including SEC will become the bar for Principal and Lead Engineers using AWS. With AWS x3 including SEC for Seniors. Professional qualifications are less easily gamed than CV filtering algorithms or toy coding problems. You'd be pretty foolish to pick a surgeon just on the basis of the keywords used on their resume or an lawyer on the basis of a fancy profile on social media. I would start by asking for the appropriate professional qualifications.

Every profession grows up. And innovators get out or get qualified.

Are you ready to raise the bar...?
