import {Android, Kotlin, Java, Google, ReactLink} from "../../src/components/Tech"

Developing an <Android/> side project this weekend and thinking about talking to some people about doing some work for
them.

I've been in the agile software engineering game for a couple of decades now. Good times and bad, set backs and
come backs. It's increasingly hard for people today to understand that back in the 90s, software engineering was
a bottom of the pile sort of job. Skill machine operators were far better paid around here. You need either capital or
connections to access the training needed. I had a couple of maths degrees and a facility with coding but neither
capital nor connections.

The last five years have seen a trend back to prolitherating specialisms. It's hard for me to explain that it's all the
same, really.

For example, I'm doing some reactive responsive <Android/>. As it happens, in <Java/> today. But maybe
<ReactLink/> or <Kotlin/> tomorrow. Different syntax, same semantics.

And even it's a mobile device, I recalled *Domain Driven Design** wisdom to help me.

This means I hit different speed bumps. It's over 20 years since I began my journey into concurrent distribute
responsive systems. As part of Apache communities, I've contributed to libraries and parsers used by millions worldwide.
In my day jobs, I've teamed up to deliver success systems.

Every particular technology mix has its own strengths and weaknesses but the biggest lesson I took away from my career
break at Manchester studying Advanced Computer Science was that the computer science fundamentals never change. It's
just that triangulation is really tough and that each particular domain and tech mix has a very different set of
tradeoffs.

One reason why I decided that it's time to get back into the game is that I'm now convinced that tools are starting
to come together to build the sorts of systems that we dreamed about when we started out back in the 90s.

It's hard to explain that the power of globally distributed communities is that people are working away on particular
facets of the whole. There's so much that needs to come together.

Some people stick to one facet and really push that forward. Other people are all about shiny excitement, helping to
popularise.

Looking back, I'd probably have to say that I'm part of the productionization crowd, buying in as
the first wave dips and shoring up all the foundations allowing.
