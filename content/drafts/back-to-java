The NJ launch for William Hill Global was a high point for me. It's great to see that the US business is now worth
over $2Bn.

I needed to regain passion and enthsuaism. I felt I need to be convinced that Orcale would become a good custodian for
Java. So I've done presonal projects in other and platforms.

I started coming back to Java during the summer 2020 and started to rediscover my passion and enthusiasm. Oracle
has done a fine job in revigirating the ecology. The release pattern is really great. It really builds confidence thta
Java is going to be around for at least the next decade.

I believe that Oracle and the OpenJDK community are doing well to walk that fine line, bringing in the new language features
needed to keep Java competitive.

Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2 are awesome. Again, kudos.
