Spring Boot ```2.3``` brought buildpacks. Which is quietly quite a big thing for microservices.

For me, advaantages such as

 * No more ```Dockerfile```
 * Declarative containerization

A key advantage promised by ```buildpacks``` is improved efficiency.

Let me explain why I've always considered committing production Dockerfiles into development repositories a little
bit of an antipattern, a evil that is no longer always necessary.

Yet again, essentially it's about separation of concerns.

Developers use Docker to developers. DevOps use Docker in production.

Every resource that's unneccearily share increases communication waste and decreases productivity.

Even when I'm solo, I find it distracting to have to consider ```DevOps``` when developing.

With GitHub and GitLab making build pipelines so easy, there are really no longer any excuses left for not adoping
continuous integration and deployment for every project. No matter how great or humble.

Pipelines allow clearly handovers to be automated and demarkated. Only after development has run all its tests,
only after the code has been checked for quality should a production image be built.

Which is another good reason for using buildpacks.
