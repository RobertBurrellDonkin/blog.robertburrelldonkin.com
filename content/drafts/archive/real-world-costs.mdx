A charitable organisation of which I am a member wrote in Feb to let me know that their IT system had been
compromised by a cybersecurity attack.

This is the first time that I personally have experienced personal financial loss from a cybersecurity attack. I can
secure my own infrastructure and take care about my own conduct online. Sadly this is no longer good enough.

Of course, I have no alternative but to to resign my membership. Appearently I expect to be reimbursed by the bank.
We'll have to wait and see whether I'll be able to make that happen.

I hope they have insurance. If not then I'm unsure whether they'll survive. Another fine institution destroyed by
negligence.

Here in England, personal liability for upstream cyberattacks rests on consumers. Had a brick-and-mortar retailer supplied
my bank account and personal details to a criminal, the retailer would have been liable.
