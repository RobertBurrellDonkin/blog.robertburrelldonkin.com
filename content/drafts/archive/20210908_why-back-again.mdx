Back again to Java.

Like many others back in the late 90s, I had my start in coding on Visual Basic but hopped onto Java.
I start learning and building stuff in Java at home. I ran Linux and MacOS but not windows and was really interested in
the internet. So Java was the obvious language to play around with at home.

After getting into open source at Apache, I made the leap into Java at work as well. Internet enabled point of sales
systems. Then onto enterprise Java.

Along the way, I picked up Python for what would later be known as DevOps. It's a great language but I'm test-infected.
So I had ideological disagreements with the early Pythonistas. Today, I'm a big fan of Python 3 and really enjoy coding
in it but back then test driven development in Python felt like cutting against the grain.

It's hard to believe these days but in the early days, JavaScript was widely seen as an evil spawned on the world by
nasty corporate influences. Thankfully, the JavaScript community worked hard over the next couple of decades to make
it into the great language it is today.

For me, the big moment around JavaScript was React. If you've ever needed to develop user interfaces backed by high
volumes of data then you'll understand that redraw was your enemy. Before React, low latency meant hand-craft what
React does right out of the box.

Which was no fun.

React is my weapon of choice for front ends.

Java, though, looked on the ropes.

The early days of Oracle seemed unconvinced. The business model wasn't clear. OpenJDK was struggling. The JCP looked dodgy.

JavaScript and Python were taking server-side mindshare. JVM languages like Scala and Kotlin looked great for some use
cases and were potentially virtual machine agnostic.

I lost confidence in Java. I wanted to give myself other options. Which added to my reasons in taking a break in 2019.

But now, it's 2021 and Java is looking great again. Oracle is looking like a good custodian. The
release train is look great and OpenJDK is looking healthy.

Java and Spring are now Reactive and Streaming.

Which is why I'm eager to get back to Java again.
