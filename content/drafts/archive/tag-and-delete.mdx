Thinking about Kata

Not a good idea to leave long running branches hanging around.

When developing an code stream, merging back into original branch is a good idea <--- rubbish, wolloheaded

Kata, want to capture an end state, a moment in time

Which means a tag.

Workflow is branch, develop, tag

This allows future branches to start from that known state.

For example around securing and endpoint

Or trying an upgrade

Or refactoring to a more elegant solution

Kata are about one sitting, really. Best to work to an end point, tag and delete the branch.

It is not uncommon to be unsatisfied. In that case, tag then come back fresh after thinking and reading to refactor
