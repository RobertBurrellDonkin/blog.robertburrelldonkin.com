I learned to learn at a time and place where every student was expected to take notes. Where I was born, textbooks
and photocopying existed but were much too valuable to waste on educating people like me.

Success in that system emphasized the ability to take notes quick and true. Make any mistakes and you'll revise
your mistakes.
Missing any lessons, and you'll need beg to copy from someone else.

This may sound tough but you get used to maintaining a mental model, listening and writing at the same time
with practice, if you're academically able. Or you learn to accept that your life will head down the vocational route,
learning on the job and at collage.

Until the 70s happened and all opportunities died.

Similar during my years at Warwick. We sat in lecture halls big and small, writing down notes from marks chualked
on a blackboard. And yes, that meant a board painted black in those days to show the marks.

Taking notes is necessary for me to really learn the details. So losing the capacity to write was quite a big deal.

I've started taking notes using cheat sheets. Not full transcriptions, that's not possible but cheatsheets.

Takes longer.
