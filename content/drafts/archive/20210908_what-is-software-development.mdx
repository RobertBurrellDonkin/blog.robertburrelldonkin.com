Fundamental misunderstanding not just of computer science but also about what a software developer really does.

A code is just a controlled vocabulary. Coding is just learning to speak to a machine in a controlled vocabulary
understood by that machine. Modern AI is incredible but also incredibly limited. Alexa speaks and listens. That's
incredible.

But Alexa is limited by the accents, dialects, languages and words that it's capable of comprehending. And requires
people to help out from time to time as well.

Controlling Alexa means adopting a modulated tone and a controlled vocabulary. It's incredible useful but it's coding.

Why don't business people just learn to code...?

Well, mastering the nuances of the controlled vocabularies takes years.

It's about business value.

As software developers, our role is to deliver business value by realising business visions.

Vast sums have been wasted by business people and software developers who fail to understand the parts they are
expected to play.

Business people need to study business models and come up with amazing visions. Software developers need to realize
awesome solutions that customers love from those dreams.

Coding really is the least part of the exercise.
