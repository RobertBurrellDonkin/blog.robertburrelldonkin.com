Speed reading is an art that software engineers would be wise to cultivate.

For me, it's all about intention.

When diving deep, you need to get yourself time to ponder, to expression.

Speed reading is about creating an outline, a structure into which details can be seamlessly slotted later.

Sometimes even I'll asy understanding and mean merely a conceptual framework.

True understand for me is about reconstruction after forgetting, about the mind itself organically organising a body of
knowledge. Adopting someone else's expressed intellectual framework is a useful intellectual exercise.

But it's a crutch. If you want to run, to fly one day you'll need to throw that away.

One trick is to speed read multiple books together.


Another trick to get the right state of mind is to break off and note stray thoughts to come back to later.
Just don't try to organise yourself, read fasting enough to let the data wash over and through your subconscious.
