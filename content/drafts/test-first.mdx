Thanks for Stephane Meerak for including a section on

It did make me realise how much I miss test-first.

Thanks to amazing initiatives, for anyone with an internet connection it's easier than ever to learn to code.
My brother and I taught ourselves to code on the ZX Spectrum back in the 80s amidst the ruins and rubble of
post-industrial West Yorks. It's great to see so many taking advantage.

After a couple of maths degrees, I started to learn the art of agile software development in the late 90s.
This small enterprise software house was an ISO9000 environment. Which led me into a lifelong appreciation for testing.
As well as continuous improvement with short cycles.

But only when Apache and open source encouraged me to adopt test-first do I really think I started to engineer
solutions. There were unended books and theses written about engineering methods.

I think that engineering is about intention. Test first starts with intention realised as a test. Only then once
I've decided what I intend the software to accomplish do I code a solution. Lean discipline means doing the least
possible. Which leads to considering other behaviour I intend.

One common reason why I find computer science graduates stumble is efficiency. Test first is only efficient if you
trust that you are capable of engineering a solution using this method that

Efficient test first requires the
confidence that comes from practice that no

Which is where I think kata are important. Practice on a small project and verify that .
