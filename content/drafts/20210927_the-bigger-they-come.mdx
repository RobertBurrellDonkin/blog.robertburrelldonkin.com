Coming back onto the market after spending the last 6 months doing professional certifications, I hadn't really expected to be asked - why would anyone with talent need to study...?


Another Monday, another secuirty incident.


Here in England, the ICO is looking to move finanical liability from companies towards reckless and negligent coders.


This has been coming for a while. Security is all about knowledge.


Yes, today I'm taking a short term financial hit but I believe that to engineer software that is good enough from a security perspective, knowledge is more important than raw coding talent.

This has been coming for a while, I think.


One day soon, I believe all professional engineers will need to temper flair and creativity with security knowledge.


I've taken a short term financial hit on this wager. Time will tell whether I'm right...
