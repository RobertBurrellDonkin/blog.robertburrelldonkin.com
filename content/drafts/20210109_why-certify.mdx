I really need to dive deeper into technologies like Apache Kafka, more than just getting back up to speed.

Certs are a great excuse.

Going forward, I think the market is changing with certificates becoming more valuable.

I often find this sort of stuff os difficult but to get the most out of a course or certificate, I find it useful
to reflect.
