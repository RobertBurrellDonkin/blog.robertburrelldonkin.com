I'm really talking about paradigms, about ways of thinking.

A request-response paradigm might be enriched with streaming data (say). A streaming solution might include
request-response legs. Most often in large scale enterprise solutions –
 * One paradigm will dominate the way the system is conceived.
 * Both paradigms will be used somewhere.

The Internet of Things domain imposes an event-driven or streaming mindset. Real life data is messy. The last legs
hops over networks which are unreliable and inconsistent.

In a data center environment – whether a private enterprise or a zone within a cloud – the environment is rich and
reliable. Yes, faults happen. Outages happen.
