In the past, it's not taken long for me to become frustrated with the limitations imposed by blogging platforms.
One reason I turned to Gatsby is the wealth of open source React components. Really easy now to enrich the content.

For example, I wanted to embed a tweet in a recent post. I just used yarn to add the component.

I like quick wins :-) (TODO emoji support -> walk throught)
