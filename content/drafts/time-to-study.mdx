I sometimes like to categorise courses.

I might describe AWS essentials as vocational. Friendly and accessible.

I often find most courses go a little bit too slowly for me. In a small group session with my personal tutor or
a lecturer at the masters level, the academic seeks to challenge and will skip right to the most challenging questions
for the most able students.

That's why discipline is needed. There are defiti challenge question coming along. It's important not to turn off
or distract myself.

i Had originally pondered revising my origianl plan, dashing off the Scala as quickly as possible. The context switch
hit me hard and it keep a little while to get back into the swing. But I know that might be a good thing. Stick
to the original plan, just get back on track.
