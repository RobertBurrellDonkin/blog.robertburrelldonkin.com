Now that solutions with hundreds of microservices are not uncommon, ```observability``` is now quite a *Big Thing*

It's often said to CompSci students that final code delivered should always be free of debugging statements.

Back in my Apache Days, before great Java IDEs and debuggers, I spent a lot of time coding using plain text editors
and using print statements to debug. And yes, I agree that every logging statement in library code should contribute
to comprehension either for a reader or a runner. Why...? Logging can be surprising expensive, at least in relative
terms for libraries.

When an open source
library includes logging statements, every user must pay that price. Allow those users who wish extra logging fork your
source and pay the performance price.

But for microservices, I preach from another Gospel. Always leave in logging statements after debugging but turn them
down to ```trace``` or ```debug``. But why...? Libraries are called within the same process. Latency is low.
Microservices are called over the network. In relative terms, unused logging statements are orders of magnitude
quicker than even the quickest network operation. The tradeoff is different in this case.
