Technologists are expected to keep up to date and spend their spare time doing stuff. I did that for years before the
injury.

I've come to think that continuing professional development is a little different. Those days were free, wild and young.
I took on crazy challenges just for the whimsy.

But I'm start with data. I'm trying to record what I'm studying. Recording enables me to review and revise.

Professional development means looking at what the market wants and seeking to fill gaps in my knowledge and skills.

Pretty clear to me that I've neglected microservices architecture.
