Face to face interviews may vary in quality or effectiveness but are at least a well known quantity.

Remote interviews are relatively novel.

Remote technical interviews have very little in common with commercial coding. Attempts to level the playing field
just tilt in favour those best prepared.

If any interview is expected to establish whether a candidates has the deep exngineering expertise required to
successfully deliver a major project under budget then candidates should prepare by reading widely and thinking.

But when interview favours shallow perceptions, it's all about practice, practice, practice.
