Why revive web bookmark sharing...?

Browsing is grant. It's great to discover new visats and perspectives.

But it's also easy to get destracted. And it's easy to lose track.

Why share...?

People started sharing for themselves as well as others. Once a link is one a blog, I can bring up the blog from
anywhere.

What's the new spin...?

Well, delicious was great but there's not enough money in this short of stuff. Too small for twitter.

Instead, I'm using Gatsby and hope to be able to use a pluggin to generate a links feed somehow. A project for another
time.

But first, data capture.
