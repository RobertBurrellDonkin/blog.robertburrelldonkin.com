Dear #linkedin - isn't it about time you did something about the courses section...? I mean it seemed like a good idea, maybe. But it's ended up in nomanslands under shell fire from both sides...


Today, I pruned my degree "courses", opting to use the "courses" space for continuing professional development. Not ideal. And thanks LinkedIn for adding in validation to prevent me from adding URLs.


I've been LinkedIn forever. I'm a bit of a completest. Back when "courses" popped up, I dutifully copied in my University courses. Though getting up at 0700 in the winter to walk up Gibbets Hill to a chilly lecture hall to learn Analysis might be described as an accomplishment, when I'm assessing candidates I care more about passing than turning up. Space for a course number but not date or results. And you have to "associate" with something that may - or may not - be a degree.


Degree courses offered by Universities are really very different from continuing professional development courses. It's about time that LinkedIn took both a little more seriously.


I'm all for a richer University section including all the courses and sections to highlight contributions to clubs and societies. Even 25 after my first masters, some recruiters are still interested. But for others, its just noise.


And time to take continued professional development more seriously. For CPD, recruiters are interested in when the courses took place, who gave the course and need a link to the course content. Courses need to be associated with skills. The same with certs. I'd love to see the course and cert badges join the assessed badge on the skill.


I think that this would help improve search results. Yes, I have HTML skill tags from way back when but over the last 12 months I've passed 5 AWS certifications and undertaken a dozen courses. Though I was really interested in the web circa 2000, no point in sending recruiters for
