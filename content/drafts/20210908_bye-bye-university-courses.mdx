I've been tidying up LinkedIn. Pruning all my degree courses.

Reminds me of gardening. Like many common people, go back a generation or three in my family tree and
you'll find professional gardeners tending the big estates or as market gardeners. I remember the tiny but incredibly
productive gardens of my grandad's generation.

But like my Kentish mother, I'm a cottage gardener. She grew up in the Kent was really at that time the Garden of England.
Like her, I prefer to plant and scatter, let things grow during the summer then cut back hard in the winter.

In terms of LinkedIn tribes, I'm also a cottage gardener. I'm happy to give features a go. See how they grow.

But there's a time to prune and cut back hard.

The courses section in LinkedIn continues to seem a muddle to me. Not rich enough nor well enough associated with
the education section to work well as a degree record of achievement.

So I'm deleted my university courses. Because they are not relevant...? Not entirely. Not really. But there a lot of them
and mathematics keywords are unlikely to rank high in LinkedIn searches.

Most importantly, LinkedIn lacks good support for continuing professional development. This is something that I
think all software engineers need to take more seriously now.

And judging by the specs I'm starting to see, employers are starting to agree. Better to have a professional
certification backed by a strong record of courses attended than some vague words about having "experience" in
a technology.

The assessed skills badge is a neat touch by LinkedIn. For me, continuing professional development is about courses
and certifications that link into skills and knowledge required by employers. I would like to see my professional
certification in AWS and Kafka badged up next to the skills.

And a proper separation between university course units
and courses associated with professional skills. Yes, some vocational course units may be associated with professional
skills. That's fine.

But there's a big difference between an academic module undertaken at masters level (say) and a vocational course on
a MOOC.

Of course, then there's the 50 skill limit. That's easily enough solved. It would make more sense to reimagine the
accomplishments section as highlights. Associate skills with each role undertaken, each course studied and each course
unit passed. 

But until LinkedIn introduces proper support for continuing professional development, I'm going to dedicate the
courses section to that.
