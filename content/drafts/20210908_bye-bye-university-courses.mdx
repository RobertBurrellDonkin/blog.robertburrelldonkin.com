I've been tidying up LinkedIn.

Reminds me of gardening. Like many common people, go back a generation or two and on both sides
you'll find professional gardeners tending the big estates. I remember the tiny but incredibly productive gardens
of my granddad and the tales of his father who - amongst other things - was a market gardener.

But I'm a cottage gardener like my mother. She grew up in the Kent was really at that time the Garden of England.
Like her, I prefer to plant and scatter, let things grow during the summer then cut back in the winter.

In terms of LinkedIn tribes, I'm also a cottage gardener. I'm happy to give things a go. See how they grow.

But there's a time to prune and cut back hard.

The courses section has always been a little bit confusing to me. Not quite just university courses and lacking the
details needed for people who did their time a while ago. For a UX perspective, the courses that composed a particular
higher education course deserve to the associated with the final degree awarded.

So I'm deleted all of them. Because they are not relevant...? Not entirely. Not really.

But since LinkedIn lacks a section for continuing professional development, I'm going to dedicate the courses section.

LinkedIn seems to be fight people like me. They've restricted the length of the number field to stop new MOOC urls
being added directly. I'll probably just have to add Udemy or Coursera. Oh well.

The best solution would be for LinkedIn to take continuing professional development more seriously by devoted
a section containing both certificates and courses undertaken. Ideally linked in to skills.
