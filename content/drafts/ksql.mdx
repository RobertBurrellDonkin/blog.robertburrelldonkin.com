One of the things I'm looking for in a course is to understand why I'd be motivated to use this technology.
With an architects hat on, *why* means *when* â€” when is this approach more suitable than the alternatives.

Yes, KSQL is advertised as lowering the learning curve for people familiar with SQL. I'm sure it does.
The feel is very familiar from the days way back when.

That's not a good enough reason, though.

It's really that thanks to Kafka Streams, Kafka now easily supports a variety of distributed data store use cases.

And KSQL is a good match for relational distributed data stores.

And why SQL...?

Well query languages offer measured flexible. Reporting

-> Manchester Advanced Computer Science...?

Exploratory <- SQL is great for exploration

Brings my back to the original purpose of query languages like SQL. It wasn'yt really simple data mapping.

It was reporting and ad hoc queries.

And yes - I do like the shallow learning curve for KSQL.

Engineers sometimes wonder why precisely a solutions architect is needed. A strong engineer needs to cover off design
and architecture skills as well as acquiring a good grounding in infrastructure. And yes, I'm able to step in as and
when needed.

But I've come to realise that this ins't the point. Stick around in the industry long enough. You'll observe plenty
of failures. In my experience, the strongest indicator of future failure is inappropriate technology mix chosen to
polish CVs.

And that's why a good architecture earns their corn. As a check and balance on engineers.
