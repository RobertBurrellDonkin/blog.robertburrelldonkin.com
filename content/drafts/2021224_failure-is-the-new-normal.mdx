Everything fails. In the cloud, failures happen all the time. That's the point â€” when failure is no longer
exception, coping with failure is just another story, another behaviour that your solution is expected to exhibit.

For the test infected, this is something that you need to test for. This is an old idea.

Good old chaos monkey. But allowing wild chaos to stuff up an environment is a hard sell. And most likely a great
way to waste vast amounts of time and money unless you're solution is already in the right space. It's advanced QA.

Just like any form of testing, really the solution should do the basic well before going anywhere near QA.

Which brings me back around to ksql. The course finished off with a nice little exhibition of the way that a
production ksql cluster behaves when servers are stopped and started.

And suddenly, I realized how testable solution resiliance now is with Docker.

This had been at the back of my mind for quite a while. But I'd been reluctant to commit.

Yes, in my head, Docker should make adding a resiliance step to the pipeline easy. But in my heart I wondered whether
it would turn out to be a rabbit hole, sucking me down into Wonderland. My fears have now been set to rest.
