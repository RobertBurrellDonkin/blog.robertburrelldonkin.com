Why coming soon...?
Why not right away...?

Fingers. I'm getting my fingers back up to speed with Java and IDEA.

I have a lot of reactive exercises lined up. Today, I'm having a go at

https://github.com/reactor/lite-rx-api-hands-on

which is really great.

I've done reactive and streaming stuff before. But back then I kept hitting blockers (in both senses).
Interesting but not ready for the prime time yet.

Sometimes I remember. Sometimes I need to consult the documentation. On occasion, I've need to consult the solution
in another branch to understand a nuance.

Project reactor is even better than when last I took a look.

Thanks to KK's course for letting me know all these resources.
