Engineers sometimes wonder why precisely a solutions architect is needed. A strong engineer needs to cover off design
and architecture skills as well as acquiring a good grounding in infrastructure. And yes, I'm able to step in as and
when needed.

But I've come to realise that this ins't the point. Stick around in the industry long enough. You'll observe plenty
of failures. In my experience, the strongest indicator of future failure is inappropriate technology mix chosen to
polish CVs.

And that's why a good architecture earns their corn. As a check and balance on engineers.
