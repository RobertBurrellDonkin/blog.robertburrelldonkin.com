I've been taking video more seriously.

I live in a listed terrace house.

I currently have a grey look. It's better that the walls but it's not the look I'm looking for.

I like the white screens that people have at google etc. Sometimes I think these are actual backings.

But I wonder whether really they're using a green screen and turning the background white.

I had a look into that but some of the apps are playing catch-up with apple security.
