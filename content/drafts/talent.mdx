One of the joys of study is the light that the new shines on the old.

The New Jersey launch was an incredibly successful project along almost every axis.

And now looking back, reflecting on the AWS advice around migrations, the most important decision taken was to
go for talent, the best in every position. Not just engineers, consultants, architects, analysts, experts in comms,
QA, agile and lean, project and technical managers but also talented tactical and strategic managers with great
programme alignment.

Too many companies, in my experience, talk a good game on talent without really taking on board or understanding
what it really means. The strategic thinkers I've worked with who have been best at delivering massive shareholder
value are those who were people focussed.
