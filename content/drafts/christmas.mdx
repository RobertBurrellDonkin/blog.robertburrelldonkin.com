-> i don't trust certificate vendors
for good reasons
First trust model. First time I sign up to a new site, I have no choice but to trust that
certificate. Other times and for mistyped, I want to be warned if the certificate changes!

old protocol, fails to separate concerns

today, probably have two protocols. First end-to-end untrusted session encryption without trust.

 * allows organised crime to pilfer bank accounts without redress

Thankfully clueful peopel like Trustonic are developing solutions to addres
