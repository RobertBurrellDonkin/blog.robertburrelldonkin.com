Spring Boot ```2.3``` brought buildpacks. Which is quietly quite a big thing for microservices.

A couple of decades ago, back in my Apache Days, I remember the energy and effort around Jakarta when Maven brought
the idea of declarative tooling into focus in the Java world. From a personal perspective, . Maybe I'll say more on
this later.

No more ```Dockerfile``` to maintain. No more research on which particular base image is the best. Just add a plugin
and allow ```Spring Boot``` to take care of those details.

```
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>build-image</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

A key advantage promised by ```buildpacks```
