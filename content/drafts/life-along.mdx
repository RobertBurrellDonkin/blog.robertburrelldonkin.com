Kudos to everyone keeping the systems running over Christmas.

After my injury, I went back to live with my parents. When the NHS turns its back on me, my parents were there for me.
Not just emotional support but also my savings would have run dry had I needed to find the money for personal as well
as health care.

For people in other countries, workers pay handsomely for the welfare state. All told, 22 pence in every pound earned.
Yes, in the US that would pay for great insurance. The Welfare State began as National Insurance. For everyone
regardless of social background or ethnic origin.

These days, until you fall there's no way to know whether there's a safety net or not.

No Statue was passed by Parliament. Indeed no Statue would have been passed.

But no one explained European Union membership would provide the ways and means to people with influence bypass
democracy.
