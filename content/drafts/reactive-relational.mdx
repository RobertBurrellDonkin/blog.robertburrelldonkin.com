Yes, they make solving easy problems easy. And enjoy a shallow learning curve for moderate loads.

Until you run into the learning cliff. Rather than a gradual ramp up, it's all plain sailing until Doh! you
run into that cliff.

Every proje.

Trailing persistence. You know you need the data stored for reporting and cold reply. And . M

Just like gears in a bike, you're looking for a smooth shifting up from a low latency approach to high throughput.
And yes, that means higher latency.
