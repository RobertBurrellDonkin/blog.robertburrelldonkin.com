Let me answer a few questions around professional certification...

Yes, I hope that the sort of organisations I'd like to engage with will start to ask for certification but I believe
that continuing professional development makes me a better software engineer.

The cloud certifications are the sort of tough challenge that rewards deep and broad study. Bit like fell running,
I suppose. We race on the fells together to challenge each other but in the end,

I've discovered that I like to have two areas of study during a low intensity phase. Next up for me are

 * AWS Data Analytics
 * AWS Software Architect Professional

but at low intensity. When I decide the time is right to be examined, I'll step up the intensity level and review the
material.

I've been asked about the resource I used.

I'm more interesting in CPD and have been in the game since the late 90s. People coming fresh and new may choose to
start elsewhere but I would recommend coming back.

I'll also line up some complementary Coursera material as well. But not quite yet.
