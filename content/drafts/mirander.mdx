scala course brings back memories of Mirander. Not some mysterious functinoal female but a programming language.

One of features I loved most about Mathematics at Warwick was the variety and flexibility that the course structure
offered. A varitable smorgasboard. From dozens of departments. Including CompSci.

On reflection, this was closer to the US style of major and minor without losing the English flavour.

One of my first year courses was functional programming featuring Mirander.

The way I remember it, the lecturer pronounced that too many people wrongly claimed that functional languages were
unsuitable for IO. So our assessed assignment was to program a maze game. I relished this challenge and ended up doing
well.

Structure procedural programming proved to hold no interest, as the course in Pascal proved.

But functional programming agreed with me then and does now.
