Reactive is awesome, right...? Everyone's knows reactive a bandwagon we should jump on to, right...?

I've done message driven systems for most of the last couple of decades so obvious
I agree that reactive matters a lot for Java but we should acknowledge that business stakeholders have every right
to ask for a little bit more detail that just "awesome coolness".

I find concrete examples are often useful. You deploy a blocking microservice. Now you want to scale elastically to
meet consumer demand. Response latency getting longer and longer until the microservice is no
longer responsive. But response looks fine. Network looks fine. What's wrong...?

Well, with blocking Java using a basic operating system metric - networking, CPU and so on - may not be useful for
elastic scalability. And virtual machines rarely expose.

So you'll need to code some custom fool.
