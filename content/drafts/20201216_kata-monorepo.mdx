Coming back after break offers the opportunity to break old habits and try out some new ideas.

I've been playing around with the idea of kata for a little while now.

A hot topic at the moment is monorepos. These are one of those ideas that are great in some cases but not so
great in others. My best guess is that things will settle down somewhere in the middle, with teams or programmes
maintaining a small number of monorepos but most enterprises wishing to retain a decompartmentalised and
decentralised model.

Back to Kata.

Before my injury, I practiced a variety of Martial Arts at various times. Karate, Nam Pai Chuan, Tai Ch, Capoeria.

Call them kata, forms, patterns or dances, all incorporated the idea that regular specific practice led to mastery.
