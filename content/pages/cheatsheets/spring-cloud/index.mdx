There's a lot of

Spring Cloud -> common patterns for *distributed system*

 * **configuration management** https://microservices.io/patterns/externalized-configuration.html externalise configuration allows same microservice to run in different environments
 * **service discovery** https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html enables a downstream service to call the right upstream instance
 * **circuit breakers** https://microservihttps://github.com/Netflix/zuul/wiki https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/wiki/How-We-Use-Zuul-At-Netflix dynamic routing layer
 * **micro-proxy** allows value to be added and observed like any other microservice
 * **control bus** https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ControlBus.html event drive control channel
 * **one-time tokens** https://microservices.io/patterns/security/access-token.html token allows upstream services to verify authorization
 * **global locks** https://hazelcast.com/blog/long-live-distributed-locks/ https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html
 * **leadership election** elect a leader from a cluster of candidates
 * **distributed sessions** distributed session data throughout a cluster of nodes with no single point of failure
 * **cluster state** distribute state throughout a cluster of nodes with no single point of failure
