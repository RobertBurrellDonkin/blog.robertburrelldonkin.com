slug: "/cheatsheets/kafka/ksql"

# History
 * KSQL -> ksqlDB
    * (push) queries -> push and pull queries
    * DIY Connectors -> Connector Integration

# Key Concepts
 * event streaming relational data source built on Kafka Streams
 * ```KTables``` and ```KStreams``` modelled as **collections**
 * **SQL** constructs and syntax widely included
 * **push queries** emit events
     * compiled into Kafka Streams applications suitable for microservices
 * **Materialized views** with **pull queries** static snapshot similar to RDBMS
 * **Connector** sinks and sources
    * ETL pipeline use cases
    * **Kafka Connect**
 * Feels like SQL
    * Specialized SQL dialect, not ANSI with enhancements
        * DDL
            * enhanced integration with schema registries
            * scheme evolution
        * DML
            * simple queries but good integration with streams
    * Interactive exploratory interface
    * Network clients
    * Functions and operators
    * eventually consistent

# Interactive Mode
 * **statement-based** replication
    * **command topic** distributes statement to nodes


# API
## DDL - Data Definition Language

### Connector Integration
 * ```CREATE SOURCE CONNECTOR `name` with (props);```
    * options for external or internal Kafka Connect cluster

## DML - Data Manipulation Language
