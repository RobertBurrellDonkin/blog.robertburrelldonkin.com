# Properties

## Required

## Key
 * ```num.stream.threads```
    * increasing tasks per thread increases CPU utilitization
    * limited by cores
    * limited by task count
 * DEFAULT_DESERIALIZATION_EXCEPTION_HANDLER_CLASS_CONFIG
    * ```LogAndFailExceptionHandler```
    * ```LogAndContinueExceptionHandler```

# APIs
 * Start
    * ```new KafkaStreams(topology, config).start()```
        * non-blocking
        * spawns processing **stream threads**
 * Stop
    * ```streams.close()```
 * High level functional **DSL**
    * ```builder.stream(name).foreach((k,v)->...)```
 * Low level **Processor API**
    * ```topology.addSource(name, source)```
    * ```topology.addProcessor(name, processor)```
 * **Stream** data model
    * represents a **topic**
    * interested in history of values for **key**
        * within retention window
    * consumed from Kafka
    * ```KStream```
    * stream of **fact**
 * **Table** data model
    * also represents a **topic**
    * interested only in **latest** (highest offset) value for **key**
    * typically compacted topic ```cleanup.policy``` set to ```compact```
    * **stateful**
    * often used for **aggregations**
    * materialized using application-side key-value store
        * default **RocksDB**
    * built on the application side
    * ```KTable```
        * also represents a **topic**
        * **partitioned** following the topic
        * **distributed** by partition
        * **time synchronized**
    * ```GlobalKTable```
        * complete unpartitioned copy
        * high local overhead for large keyspaces
        * **not** time synchronized
            * joins always against the latest
    * behaviours
    * relationships between events
    * **stream-relational** snapshot of moving stream of facts
 * **Stream-Table Duality**
    * a stream might be reconstitute a table
    * table changes might be logged as a stream

# Operations
 * **Stateful**
    * ```Table``` views
    * typical use cases
        * **joining**
        * **aggregating**
        * **windowing**
    * topology includes **any** stateful operator
    * **co-partitioning** may be required
      * **related** events need to be handled by same task
        * same **partition**
            * keyed by same field partitioned to same partition
 * **Stateless**
    * ```Stream``` views **only**
    * no memory needed of previous events
    * topology includes **no** stateful operators
    * **repartitioning** operators
        * send to new internal topic
        * read back from internal topic
        * network round trip cost means these are often expensive operations

 * **Sinks**

## Sinks ###
 * ```to``` topology **terminator**
 * ```through``` **deprecated** **sub-topology**
 * ```repartition``` **sub-topology**

## Stateless
 * ```filter```
    * filter as early as possible to reduce wasted processing
 * ```filterNot```
    * syntactic sugar
    * improves readability
 * ```print```
 * ```branch```
 * ```map``` **re-keys**
 * ```mapValues``` **retains key**
    * more efficient than ```map``` unless **rekeying**
 * ```flatMap``` multiple outputs for each input **re-keys**
 * ```flatMapValues``` multiple outputs for each input **retains key**
    * more efficient than ```map``` unless **rekeying**
 * ```merge```
 * ```selectKey``` - **re-keys**

## Stateful
 * joins
    * ```join``` both sides share key
    * ```leftJoin``` when no match for left, right ```null```
    * ```outerJoin``` when no match, other side ```null```
    * **co-partitioning**
        * same number of partitions on each side of join checked at start up
        * **unless** ```GlobalKTable```
    * **changelog** internal topic backs state store
 * aggregation
    * **group by** before aggregation operation
        * ```groupBy``` **repartitions** via internal topic
        * ```groupByKey``` more efficient (less network costs) when retaining same key
        * ```KGroupedStream```
    * ```aggregate``` any type
    * ```reduce``` same type
    * ```count```
    * aggregating streams requires
        *```initializer```
        * ```adder```
    * aggregating tables
        *```initializer```
        * ```adder```
        * ```subtractor```
 * windowing
    * ```windowBy```

# Windowing

 * Time Semantics
    * **Event time** when created at source
    * **Ingestion time** when appended to a topic on the broker
        * sometimes used to approximate *event time*
    * **Processing time** when processed by streams application
    * **Stream time** highest timestamp so far seen
 * ```DEFAULT_TIMESTAMP_EXTRACTOR_CLASS_CONFIG``` **Timestamp extractor** used in windowing operations
    * ```FailOnInvalidTimestamp``` **default**  uses record timestamp
        * ```message.timestamp.type``` on broker controls how this is set
        * ends processing should an event have an invalid timestamp
    * ```LogAndSkipOnInvalidTimestamp``` uses record timestamp
        * ```message.timestamp.type``` on broker controls how this is set
        * ignores events with invalid timestamps
    * ```WallclockTimestampExtractor``` uses processing time
        * unusual choice for windowing
    * Or custom extractor from data
        * return negative timestamp to skip
 * Window Types
    * **Tumbling** ```TimeWindows.of(duration)```
        * fixed size
        * no overlap
        * each event in unique window
    * **Hopping** ```TimeWindows.of(duration).advanceBy(duration)```
        * fixed size
        * may overlap
        * one event may be in more than one window
    * **session** ```SessionWindow.with(duration)```
        * variable sized
        * separated by inactivity
        * no guarantees of alignment between keys
    * **sliding** aka **join** ```JoinWindow.of(duration)```
        * fixed size
        * based on event time difference
 * Window operations produce windowed tables with multidimensional keys
 * Window Results
    * Event ordering in the log may not be the same as event time
    * Events may be delayed
    * Emission tradeoff latency vs completeness
        * **default** optimizes latency using **continuous refinement**
        * set **grace** to keep window open ```TimeWindows.of(duration).grace(duration)```
        * suppress intermediary results
            * ```Suppressed.untilWindowCloses``` emits final
            * ```Suppressed.untilTimeLimit``` limits rate
            * ```BufferConfig``` tunes buffering strategy
 * **Partition group** buffers events from each stream
    * priority given to **lowest** timestamp
    * adjust slighty out-of-order


# State Stores

## Types

### Key Value Stores
 * as opposed to windowed stores
 * One application may contain many state stores
 * Types
    * **embedded** are internal and local associated with a task
        * colocation improves availability and reduces network traffic
        * fault tolerance through replay
            * **stand by*** aka **shadow** replicas reduce fault recovery time
        * high read availability through **stand by*** aka **shadow** replicas
        * **persistent** write to local disk
            * ```STATE_DIR_CONFIG``` default ```/tmp```
            * limited by disk, not memory, space
            * restored from disk, not rebuilt, potentially quicker recovery time
            * slower

### Windowed Stores
 * Support different interactive
 * Multidimensional keys

## Materilized Stores
 * enables **interactive queries***
 * force materialization to allow read only access outside the topology
 * access by name and type using ```QueryableStoreTypes``` factory
 * queries vary by store type
 * iterators need to be closed
 * queries include only local data
 * global queries will require remote calls
    * ```APPLICATION_SERVER_CONFIG``` communicated via **consumer group** to other group members
    * ```queryMetadataForKey``` discovers instance that key is partitioned onto
        * this uses partitioner to establish where the key would be located
    * ```allMetadataForStore``` discovers all stores


# Schemas

## Avro
 * **Generic records** when schema isn't available at runtime
 * **Specific records** generated from and include schema definition

## Schema Registry
 * Reduces message size by including ID for schema.
 * ```schema.registry.url```
 * ```AvroSerdes```
