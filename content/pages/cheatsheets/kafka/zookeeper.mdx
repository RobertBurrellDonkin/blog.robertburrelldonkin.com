# Key Features
 * distributed configuration
    * key value store
    * ```znodes``` tree
 * election and consensus
 * distributed locks and coordination

# Architecture
 * Tree of ```znodes```
    * leafs
    * has a paths
    * persistent
    * ephemeral
        * lost after app disconnects
    * **no** renaming
    * ```WATCH``` for changes

# Zookeeper and Kafka
 * broker registration
    * heartbeat
 * topics list
    * configuration
    * in sync replicas
 * leader elections
 * cluster id
 * ```ACL```s
 * ```Quotas```

## Configuration
 * Hard to optimize but start with reasonable defaults
    * ```dataDir```
    * ```clientPort```
    * ```maxClientCnxn```
    * ```tickTime``` **2000**
    * ```initLimit``` **10** ticks
    * ```syncLimit``` **5** ticks
    * ```server.n```

# Quorum
 * Quorum Sizing Strategy
    * strict majority required for voting
        * **odd** number of servers
    * tradeoffs
        * more instances
            * slower to make decisions
            * more resilience
            * combinatorics
    * **3** ZooKeepers fine for moderate deployments
    * **5** more communication inter server
        * needed for big loads
        * ZooKeeper sensitive to latency, need powerful machines
    * **7** rare
