# AdminClient API

## Design Principals

 * **Asynchronous**
    * ```Result``` wrappers for ```Future```
    * Considered complete on the **client** after **Controller** state updated
 * Eventually consistent
    * Success may be returned before change propagated to all brokers
    * Read operations directed to least loaded broker, write to **Controller**
 * **Options** parameter object specific to call
 * **Flat Hierarchy**

## Properties
### Required
 * ```bootstrap.servers```
  * comma-separated ```host:port``` list of brokers
  * at least one required
  * no requirement for all brokers
  * if all listed brokers are down, producer cannot make initial connection to cluster

### Key Parameters
 * ```client.dns.lookup``` special case handling
    * ```resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only``` SASL with single DNS alias
    * ```use_all_dns_ips``` DNS alias listing IPs
 * ```request.timeout.ms``` default **120s** includes retries

## Use Cases
 * Verify that topics have been set up correctly on start-up
    * In particular, compaction
 * Logging topic configuration on error or at start-up
 * Exposing topic configuration as application metric
 * Allowing an application to create clean topics when starting in development mode
 * Exploring consumer groups to troubleshoot
 * Read consumer lag directly via ```listConsumerGroupOffsets```
 * Ad hoc tooling for site recovery by modifying consumer group data
    * modifying offsets only allowed when group is **not active**
 * Collect cluster meta-data metrics
 * Deleting records for legal reasons
 * Triggering leader elections
 * Reassign replicas

## Testing
 * ```MockAdminClient```
