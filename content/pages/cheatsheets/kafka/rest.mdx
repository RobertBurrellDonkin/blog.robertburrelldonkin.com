title: Cheatsheet – Apache Kafka – REST Proxy
slug: "/cheatsheets/kafka/rest"

# REST Proxy
 * Independent component
 * Communicates with
    * cluster
    * schema registry
 * Provides HTTP-based producers and consumers
    * ```JSON``` to
        * full Avro
        * binary
    * good for missing features especially those without good Avro support
 * lower throughput than native
 * caller responsible for batching

## Deployment and Scaling Out
 * ```kafka-rest-start```
    * ```kafka-rest-properties```
 * ```kafak-rest-stop```
 * multiple instances behind load balancer
    * but note impact on consumers
    * correct configuration needed

# Key Aim
 * Expose functionality of existing command line tools, consumer and producers over HTTP.
    * Still a work in progress...

# Key Features
 * most cluster **metadata**
 * **producer**
    * instances are **shared**
        * **not** possible to configure per request
 * **consumer**
    * **stateful** bound to instance
        * limited configuration per request
 * formats
    * JSON
    * raw ```base64```
    * JSON-encoded, schema registered
        * Avro
        * Protobuf
        * JSON Schema
 * **admin**
    * topic configurations

## Not Supported
 * Multi-topic produce requests
 * Most Producer/Consumer overrides

# Production Considerations
 * Hardware
    * Memory
        * 1GB heap typical
            * scale out to avoid long GC pauses
        * consider number of concurrent consumers
            * ~16Mb per consumer
            * buffers
                * ```fetch.max.message.bytes``` x ```queued.max.message.chunks```
                * ```consumer.request.max.bytes``` response buffer
    * CPU
        * ```16``` recommended
        * more cores better than faster cores
        * threading model, cores limit concurrent requests
    * Disks
        * logging only
    * Network
        * highest impact
        * standard data center fine for most
        * co-locate with cluster to reduce latency
 * JVM
    * Java 8
        * ```G1``` collector
 * Load balancing
    * absolute URLs returned so each server needs to be addressable
    * consumers are stateful so **sticky** load balancer
        * unless consumer correctly addresses URLs returned

# Properties

## Key
 * ```boostrap-servers```
 * ```schema-registry-url```
 * ```id``` **unique**
 * tuning
    * ```consumer.request.max.bytes``` tradeoff, limits batching
    * ```fetch.min.bytes```
    * ```consumer.request.timeout.ms``` enables batching, tradesoff with latency
    * ```consumer.threads``` **must** set higher than max consumers in a group

# Monitoring
 * per server
    * ```connections-opened-rate```
    * ```connections-closed-rate```
 * and per endpoint

# Security
 * authorization
    * REST proxy **translates**
        * Set up ACLs on brokers
