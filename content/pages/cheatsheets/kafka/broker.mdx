title: Cheatsheet – Apache Kafka – Broker
slug: "/cheatsheets/kafka/broker"
---

# Properties
## Essential
 * ```broker.id```
 * ```log.dirs```
 * ```zookeeper.connect```

# Monitoring

## Key Metrics
 * ```ActiveControllerCount``` should be **1** (or **0***) **2** (or more) troubles
 * ```EventQueueEvent``` **controller**
    * continuously increases or fails to drop then controller may be stuck
 * ```RequestHandlerIdleRatio``` high impact on this pool as load increases
 * ```AllTopicsBytesIn``` overall growth trend
    * with ```AllTopicsMessagesIn``` gives average message size
 * ```AllTopicsBytesOut``` overall growth trend
    * includes replicas
 * ```PartitionCount``` useful when topic creation is enabled
 * ```LeaderCount``` should be evenly distributed
    * indicates when a preferred leader election may be needed
 * ```OfflinePartitionCount``` **critical**
 * **JVM**
    * Garbage Collection
    * file descriptors
        * ```OpenFileDescriptorCount```
        * ```MaxFileDescriptorCount```

## Key Logging
 * factor out
    * ```kafka.controller.``` **controller** ```INFO```
    * ```kafka.server.ClientQuotaManager``` **quotas** ```INFO```
 * compaction
    * ```kafka.log.LogCleaner``` **DEBUG**
    * ```kafka.log.LogCleanerManager``` **DEBUG**
    * ```kafka.log.Cleaner``` **DEBUG**

## Troubleshooting

 * Cluster issues
    * single broker problems
        * Show up as outliers in metrics
        * So collect individual metrics and compute outliers
        * Especially ```OS``` metrics particularly hardware
            * slow disks
            * saturated IO
        * Load imbalances
            * hot partitions
            * run **preferred leader election** first
    * cluster overload
        * load balanced but many brokers show
            * low request handler idle pool ratio
            * evelated latency for requests
    * controller problems
        * harder to diagnose
            * broker metadata out of sync
            * topic control command problems
            * replicas unexpectedly offline
        * monitor
            * active controller count
            * controller queue size
    * under replicated partitions
        * threaten fault tolerance
        * expected to be non-zero on occasion
            * false positives as a solo alerting metric
        * steady
            * likely indicates one or more broker fallen out of the cluster
                * check broker and connectivity for problems
        * ```kafka-topics``` **describe**
        * cluster level problems
            * resources
                * OS metrics
                    * CPU
                    * network
                    * disk
            * imbalance
                * metrics **per broker** and check for evenness
                    * partition count
                    * leader partition count
                    * all topics message in rate
                    * all topics bytes in rate
                    * all topics bytes out rate
                * fix using ```kafka-reassign-partitions``` tool
                * or ```kafka-assigner```
        * run SMART tools regularly
 * TLS
    * performance
        * on Linux, ```NativePRNG``` uses a global lock
            * consider setting ```ssl.secure.random.implementation=SHA1PRNG```
                * non-blocking
                * good performance under heavy load
    * ```openssl s_client```


# Monitoring
 * Yammer Metrics
    * via **JMX**
        * use local agent to report stats
        * remote **disabled** by default
            * ```KAFKA_JMX_OPTS``` environment variable

# Architecture
 * **record batch**
    * disc format
        * magic **2**
            * ```CRC-32``` after **magic byte**
            * preserves original first and last offset/sequence
            * possible to have cleaned logs with no messages
 * **control batch** one **control record**
    * filters out aborted transactions
 * **write**
 * pagecache-centric design
