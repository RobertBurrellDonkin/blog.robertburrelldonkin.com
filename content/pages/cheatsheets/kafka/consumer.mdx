# Consumer Groups
 * Consumer maintain membership in consumer group and ownership of partitions by **heartbeats**
    * **heartbeats** sent to broker designated as **group coordinator** for that consumer group
    * **heartbeats** sent using background thread
    * too many missed **heartbeats** triggers rebalance
 * Rebalances
    * Type depends on partition assignment strategy
        * **Eager Rebalance**
            * unavailable for window
            * all consumers stop, leave, rejoin with new assignment
        * **Cooperative Rebalance** aka **incremental partitions**
            * iterations based on partition subsets
            * important
                * in large consumer groups
                * when some consumers may take time to complete processing
 * Consumer group leader
    * **first** consumer to join group
    * assigns partitions
 * Static group membership
    * ```group.instance.id``` makes consumer a static member
    * static members do not leave on shutdown
    * should a second member with the same ```group.instance.id``` try to join then error
    * ```session.timeout.ms``` should be set
        * high enough to avoid rebalances on restart but
        * low enough to avoid too large data gaps for assigned partitions
 * ```offsets.retention.minutes``` on broker defaults to **7 days**
    * limits retention for empty groups
    * If members rejoin an empty group after this time, the group will behave as if its new

## Standalone Consumers
 * No consumer group
 * ```subscribe``` to a topic
 * ```assign``` particular partitions
 * but **not both** at the same time


# Properties

## Required
 * ```bootstrap.servers```
  * comma-separated ```host:port``` list of brokers
  * at least one required
  * no requirement for all brokers
  * if all listed brokers are down, producer cannot make initial connection to cluster
 * ```key.desercializer```
 * ```value.deserializer```

## Important
 * ```group.id``` consumer group
    * almost all consumers will be part of a group to allow scaling out horizontally

### Throughput, Memory Use, Availability

 * ```fetch.min.bytes``` defaults to **1**
    * set higher
        * if consumers uses too much CPU when little data available
        * to reduce broker load for large numbers of consumers
 * ```fetch.max.wait.ms``` defaults to **500ms**
    * in conjunction with ```fetch.min.bytes```
    * to limit potential latancy set lower
 * ```fetch.max.bytes``` defaults to **50MB**
    * limits memory required on consumer
    * if first batch exceeds fetch size then limit will be ignored
 * ```max.poll.records``` max number
    * limits processing needed per poll
 * ```max.partition.fetch.bytes```
    * most often ```fetch.max.bytes``` more useful
 * ```session.timeout.ms``` defaults to **10s**
    * lower values trade faster recovery for more rebalances
 * ```heartbeat.interval.ms```
    * often set to one-third of ```session.timeout.ms```
 * ```max.poll.interval.ms``` default **5 mins**
    * to cover the case where the consumer thread is locked but the **heartbeat** thread continues
    * high enough to cover maximum time between polls for health consumer but low enough to prevent damage from hung consumer
 * ```default.api.timeout.ms``` excludes ```poll``` timeout default **1 min**
 * ```request.timeout.ms``` defaults **30s**
    * when the broker has not responded within this time, close the connection and reconnect
    * overloaded brokers need time to respond
    * disconnect and reconnect adds overhead
 * ```auto.offset.reset``` sets behaviour when consumer begins to read a partition without a valid committed offset
    * ```latest``` **default** reads events sent after consumer starts
    * ```none``` raises exception for custom handling
    * ```earliest``` reads from first event retained in log
 * ```enable.auto.commit```
    * ```true``` **default** automatically commit every ```auto.commit.interval.ms```
    * ```false``` program must include commit logic
 * ```partition.assignment.strategy``` pass class name
    * ```Range``` consecutive subset
    * ```RoundRobin```
    * ```Sticky``` balanced but retains as many as possible after rebalance
    * ```CooperativeSticky```
 * ```client.rack``` location awareness
    * enables consumer read from closest relica rather than leader
    * in cloud deployments, often zone
 * ```receive.buffer.bytes```
  * **-1** indicates OS default
  * set higher when network links has high latency and lower bandwitch eg **WAN**
 * ```send.buffer.bytes```
  * **-1** indicates OS default
  * set higher when network links has high latency and lower bandwitch eg **WAN**

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting
 * ```client.id``` logical name string identified client application in metrics, logs and quotas


# Consumer Structure

## Topic Subscription

```consumer.subscribe(topics)```

 * One or more topics
 * Static or dynamic
 * Regex supported
    * When new topic matching regex is added then rebalance will be triggered
    * Performance overhead

## Pool loop

```consumer.pool(timeout)```

 * consumer must continue to poll or be considered dead
    * ```max.poll.interval.ms```
 * one consumer per thread
 * ```enable.auto.commit``` **true** then
    * every ```auto.commit.interval.ms```
    * **commit** last offset in last poll
    * checked in ```poll``` and ```close```
    * increases messages duplicated during rebalance
    * increases opportunties for missing messages
 * ```enable.auto.commit``` **false** then
    * responsibility falls on developer
    * ```commitSync``` commits last offset returned by last poll
        * retries any error that cannot be recovered
        * very little useful handling possible for errors
        * blocking
        * limits throughput
    * ```commitSync(offsets)``` commits specific offsets
    * ```commitAsync```
        * does not retry
    * ```commitAsync(callback)```
        * be aware that using callback for retry risks committing an earlier offset, increasing duplicates on rebalance
            * often use sequence number to retry only latest
        * failure to retry intermitant failures less important than committing last offset before rebalance or close
        * ```commitSync``` before ```close``` common pattern
    * ```commitAsync(offsets, callback)``` commits specific offsets
    * **Rebalancing listeners** ```subscribe(topics, listener)
        * useful for
            * closing resources
            * committing offsets
        * ```onPartitionsAssigned``` after partitions assigned, before consumption
        * ```onPartitionsRevoked```
        * ```onPartitionsLost``` exceptional case
        * Seek once partitions assigned
            * Allows consumers to start from particular offsets, rather than last committed
                * ```seekToBeginning```
                * ```seekToEnd```
                * ```seek(partition, offset)``` offsets might be stored in some other system
                * storing in a data source allows atomic transaction
            * Allows ```exactly-once``` semantics to be engineered
    * ```consumer.wakeup``` called from another thread calls ```poll``` to fail with ```WakeupException```
        * Use ```ShutdownHook``` when running from main thread

# Schema
## Avro
    * Recommended to generate classes from schema

### Key Advantages
    * Schema Compatibility
    * Binary

### Key Disadvantage
    * Schema included within file

## Schema Registry

 * Serdes identify immutable schema versions by ID and store in registry

## Key Properties

    * ```schema.registry.url```
    * ```key.deserializer```
    * ```value.deserializer```
