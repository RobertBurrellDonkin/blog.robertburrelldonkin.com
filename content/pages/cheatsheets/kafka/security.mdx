# Key Concepts
 * **Clients** internal on **LAN** and external
    * ```Producer```
    * ```Consumer```
 * **Brokers**
    * ```Leader```
    * ```Followers```
 * **Zookeeper**

# Key Qualities
 * **Authentication**
 * **Authorization**
 * **Encryption**
 * **Auditing**
 * **Quotas**

# Key Considerations
  * Authenticity
    * **Client** authenticity
    * **Broker** authenticity
  * Auditability
  * Availability for all resources to all actors
    * **DDOS**
    * out of control clients
  * Data
    * **privacy**
    * **integrity**
    * **access control**
  * Membership
    * **consumer group** access control

# Protocols

## Endpoints
 * **TLS**
    * authentication
    * encryption
    * zero-copy **not** supported for **TLS**
    * significant additional overhead
    * considerations
        * renegotiation not allowed
        * TLSv1.1 not allowed
        * restrict ciphers
        * stores
            * file permissions
            * short lived keys
            * certificate revocation
        * TLS expensive
            * restrict access (limits and quotas) to make DOS more difficult
            * ```connection.failed.authentication.delay.ms```
            * Java 9+ big performance improvement for TLS over Java 8
 * **SASL**
    * authentication
 * Supported
    * Transport Layers
        * **SSL**
        * **PLAINTEXT**
    * Authentication layers
        * **SSL**
        * **SASL** out of the box
            * ```sasl.jaas.config``` **JAAS** configures login module and options
                * **broker** prefixes with listener and mechanism
                    * eg ```listener.name.external.gssapi.sasl.jaas.config```
                * recommended over setting JVM property ```java.security.auth.login.config```, more granular control
            * ```sasl.enabled.mechanisms``` one or more
                * ```GSSAPI``` Keberos in particular Active Directory
                * ```PLAIN``` user/password external store
                    * Configured using **JAAS**
                * ```SCRAM``` no store needed
                    * **S**alted **C**hallenge **R**esponse **M**echanism
                    * requires secure ZooKeeper
                    * cached, notified
                    * ```SCRAM-SHA-256```
                    * ```SCRAM-SHA-512```
                    * ```kafka-configs```
                    * On user deletion, existing connection remain
                        * consider reauthentication interval
                * ```OAUTHBEARER``` OAuth with custom callbacks
                    * built-in uses JWT, not recommended for production
                    * use TLS to prevent evesdropping on  tokens
                    * set reauthentication interval to prevent connections overliving tokens
            * **Keberos V5**
                * clock synchronization
                * secure DNS
                * random broker passwords
                * protect keytabs
                * most importantly Microsoft active directory
    * options
        * ```PLAINTEXT```
        * ```SSL```
        * ```SASL_PLAINTEXT```
        * ```SASL_SSL```
    * broker-broker
        * ```inter.broker.lister.name``` client
        * ```server.inter.broker.lister.name``` server
    * client-broker
        * ```listerners```
        * ```advertised.listeners```
        * ```listener.security.protocol.map```
        * ```security.protocol```

## Authentication
 * ```KafkaPrincipal``` client identity
    * **authorization**
    * **quotas**
    * ```principal.builder.class``` broker-side custo
    * ```User:ANONYMOUS``` indicates unauthenticated
 * Delegation tokens
    * ```kafka-delegation-tokens```
    * An authenticated client can create delegation token
    * Distributed to workers to allow direct access to brokers
    * ```SASL/SCRAM``` at least one mechanism must be configured on brokers
    * ```delegration.token.master.key``` all brokers must have same
 * Reauthentication
    * ```SASL``` **only**
        * ```TLS``` renegotiation has known vulnerabilities
            * Use ```Deny ACLs``` to disable access instead
    * ```connections.max.reauth.ms```
        * limiting connection lifetime to token validity
        * enforce password rotation
        * checks revoked or expired credentials

## Encryption
 * End-to-end encryption
    * Custom provider plugins for clients
        * **Serdes**
        * Typically ```AES``` from a ```KMS```
        * Integrity by signing payload
        * SALT in headers
        * key rotation poses questions about compaction and retention
            * one solution would be re-encryption
        * compression should be turned off
            * compression after encryption not effective
            * compression before encryption opens doors to compression attacks

# Configuration
## TLS
 * encryption ```SSL``` ```SSL_SASL```
  * broker
    * key store with
        * private key
        * certificate
    * trust store
        * CA certificate or signed broker cert
    * cert
        * with hostname in
            * ```Subject Access Name``` **SAN** or
            * ```Common Name``` **CN**
        * wildcards ease administration
        * **default** clients check hostname
            * tradeoff between maintability and security
  * client authentication ```ssl.client.auth```
    * ```ssl.client.auth=requested``` allows anonymous clients
    * ```ssl.client.auth=required```
    * client
        * key store
            * ```ssl.principal.mapping.rules```
                * **default** ```Distinguished Name``` **DN**
    * broker
        * trust store with either
            * client cert
            * or signing CA
  * inter-broker
    * broker trust stores need certs for other brokers in cluster
  * trust store
    * ```ssl.truststore.location```
    * ```ssl.truststore.type```
    * ```ssl.truststore.password```
    * may be omitted when keys signed by authority trusted by Java
  * key store
    * ```ssl.keystore.location```
    * ```ssl.keystore.type```
    * ```ssl.keystore.password```
    * ```ssl.key.password```
  * update stores before certificates expire
    * Admin API
    * ```kafka-config```

# Operations
 * Rolling phased updates
    * Add, stabilize, remove

# Authorization
 * ```authorizer.class.name```
    * ```AclAuthorizer``` **default**
        * ```super.users```
            * revocation requires restart
            * access unrestricted by ACLS
        * ```allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found```
            * useful during cluster set up
        * access control lists
        * stored in ZooKeeper
            * ZooKeeper should be secured
        * cached in memory
        * authorized action if there is at least one **allow** and no **deny** ACLs
        * ```kafka-acls```
        * ACL Binding
            * Resource Type
                * ```Cluster```
                * ```Topic```
                * ```Group```
                * ```TransactionalId```
                * ```DelegrationToken```
            * Pattern Type
                * ```Literal```
                * ```Prefixed```
            * Resource Name may include wildcard
            * Operation
                * ```Describe``` implicitly granted by ```Read```, ```Write```, ```Alter```, ```Delete```
                * ```Create```
                * ```Delete```

                * ```Write```
                * ```DescribeConfig``` implicitly granted by ```AlterConfigs```
                * ```AlterConfigs```
            * Permission type
                * ```Allow```
                * ```Deny``` **higher precedence**
            * Principal
            * Host
                * client source address

# Auditing

    * ```kafka.authorizer.logger``` **authorization**
        * ```INFO``` **denied**
        * ```DEBUG``` **granted**
    * ```kafka.request.logger``` **requests**
        * ```DEBUG``` includes **principal**

# ZooKeeper
