In the internet, it's always Autumn.

Every internet age has its golden Summer before the masses catch up, tune in and turn up.

The early 00s was a golden age for search. At least for searches useful for software developers. Before Google,
searching for something about ```xml``` on Alta Vista meant wading through pages of NSFW soft core adverts.
There's a time and place for all things. But for me, ```xml``` and porn are no happy bed fellows.

Google was different. Google was clean. Google was shiny.

When you searched for ```xml``` on Google, you turned up useful information and erudite opinions by people you
wanted listen to.

There are just so many details.

Too much information to locate.

I used to find my blog useful as a way to find stuff I spotted.

This is a messy engineering blog, from the trenches (as they say). From within my workshop.

So please don't expect finished, polished works. Just stuff I'm playing around with at the moment.

One day I might run an indexer. Perhaps.

## Mockito

        when(repository.listAll()).thenReturn(Flux.just(aTodo()));
```
