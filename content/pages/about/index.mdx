Hello!

I'd like to share some material on the science, art and craft of software engineer with you.

I've been helping to deliver interesting projects since the last days of the last millenium. Sometimes solo but most
often in teams using open source, agile and lean methodologies.

My brother and I taught ourselves to code on the ZX Spectrum. After a couple of maths degrees, I was fortunate enough to
get a break into software development in the late 90s. 

My injury forced me to moderate the volume but after decade of recovering, maybe it's overdue time to start dusting off
the wings and thinking about flying again.
