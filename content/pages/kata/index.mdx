Kata have been on my mind for a while. Ops have game days and so on.

Back before the injury, I enjoyed martial arts and study several. Kata is a Japanese loan word. Form is the word
my sifu used for similar exercises. When talking Tai Chi, sometimes patterns are preferred. Setting aside whether
whether Capoeira is a martial dance rather than an art, Roda. Roda feels more like pair programming, creating something
wonderful together embedding

Like so much in Agile and Lean software development, I'll stick with the Japanese and Kata - though maybe one day I'll
be lucky enough pair up and Roda some.

Where am I going...?

Well, microservice kata are a fine way to get up to speed. Microservices are all about being lean, doing one thing well.
For professionals, that means being able to create new microservices quickly. Modern technologies like Spring Boot
and AWS Lambda allow just that.

But only with practice.

I've found that it's really not a good idea to try to write up a spec at the time. You need to invest some time in
creating specifications beforehand.

Like forms and kata. Especially in the world of Chinese martial arts, there is a long tradition of masters creating
forms which embody the spirit of their school.

I've tried a few ways and means in the past. I'm pondering using this blog.

Why...? GitHub is great but lacks meta-organisations. It's just a big pile of code repos.

When I feel like trying a kata, I want to quickly go to the right place.

And microservice kata can be language and framework agnostic.

Would be great to have a community to share and improve but let's start...
