Kata have been on my mind for a while. Ops have game days and so on.

Back before the injury, I enjoyed martial arts and study several. Kata is a Japanese loan word. Form is the word
my sifu used for similar exercises. When talking Tai Chi, sometimes patterns are preferred. Setting aside whether
whether Capoeira is a martial dance rather than an art, Roda. Roda feels more like pair programming, creating something
wonderful together embedding 

Like so much in Agile and Lean software development, I'll stick with the Japanese and Kata - though maybe one day I'll
be lucky enough pair up and Roda some.
