At 20. the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) is the world's largest open source foundation.

But like the internet, things started in much smaller and tighter communities.

## Old Apache Days

I started getting involved with Apache and contributing to open source just before the turn of the millenium.
This was around the time that Apache started to build communities of Java programmers mostly under the Jakarka
project named after the meeting room at Sun where key code donations were discussed.

I was elected a Member of the Apache Software Foundation in the mid 00s. This meant a lot to me. The Members are
the legal custodians of the Foundation.

## Injury Time

The road to recovering the use of my hands meant cutting many things I loved out of my life. No more cricket. No more
motorbikes. No more music.

And no more Apache.

At least for a while.

## Back at Apache

The Apache Software Foundation celebrated its 20th Anniversary in 2019. One of the personal reasons why I took a break
was to attend the conference in Las Vegas. Which was great. Amazing to see so many people, meet so many old friends and
hear about so many new challenges!

Attending Apache@Home in 2020 was really inspiring too.

So I've restored my account and hope to start getting involved again.
