## ApacheCons


### Old Apache Days

#### The Mövenpick Years

 * [ApacheCon EU2007](https://archive.apachecon.com/eu2007/)

ApacheCon EU spent three years at The Mövenpick Hotel in Amsterdam.

I stayed in a variety of cheap Hostels. All great, giving a real taste of Amsterdam. I preferred to sleep as little
as possible so this suited me really well.

So many memories but they all seem to blur together into one long conference...
