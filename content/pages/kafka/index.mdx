title: Apache Kafka
slug: "/lifelong-learning/kafka"
---
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an amazing open source distributed event streaming platform.
I've been engineering distributed event driven solutions for many years. [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/)
is great but like many data engineers, my journey took me from ActiveMQ on to Kafka. Kafka really shines as throughput
rises.

Kafka was open sourced by [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) in 2011 and came to the
[Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) through the [Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/).
(This happened after injury short my contributions in the Incubator.)

# Lifeline Learning

import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

As software mainstreams, I'm coming around to the idea that <GatsbyLink to='/memberships/bcs'>professional
software engineers</GatsbyLink> **not only need to know but need to be seen to know**.

## Continuing Professional Development

The Kafka ecosystem has a vibrant community with many related projects, both commercial and open source. Everything
is expanding so fast.

I have delivered successful microservices with Apache Kafka but with so many architectural and engineering options
available, I'm keen to keep up to date. Kafka is going interesting places. I want to follow along with that journey.
