[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an amazing open source distributed event streaming platform.
I've been engineering distributed event driven solutions for many years. [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/)
is great but like many data engineers, my journey took me from ActiveMQ on to Kafka. Kafka really shines as throughput
rises.

Kafka was open sourced by [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) in 2011 and came to the
[Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) through the [Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/).
(This happened after injury short my contributions in the Incubator.)

The Kafka ecosystem includes a vibrant community and many related projects, both commercial and open source.
