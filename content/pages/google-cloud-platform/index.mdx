[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)

import { Link as GatsbyLink } from "gatsby";

As [software mainstreams](https://www.satellitetoday.com/innovation/2019/02/26/microsoft-ceo-every-company-is-now-a-software-company/), I'm

software engineers</GatsbyLink> **not only need to know but need to be seen to know**.

## Continuing Professional Development

I'd like to get involved with a project shipping on GCP. So I'm building skills in this area.
