Hello!

I'd like to share some material on the science, art and craft of software engineer with you.

I've been helping to deliver solutions since the last days of the last millenium. Sometimes solo but most
often in teams using open source, agile and lean methodologies.

This of this not as a shop window. There are many fine blogs offering polished posts.

But as a door left ajar to give a little glimpse into my workshop.
