## A Little Back Story

Back when the blogging was new, I had "Wierdest Undreampt Use Case". Then I added "It's Tech Up North" on blogger, a richer experience with more media. 

After the injury in 2010, blogging was something I needed to leave behind to survive the journey back to software engineering. 

Now, it's 2020 and I'm returning once more to data engineering after a bit of a career break. I'm feeling strong enough to pick up blogging again.

This is the source for my third blog - [A Life Engineering Software](https://blog.robertburrelldonkin.com/).

Where *Wierdest Undreampt Use Case* was edgy, as the name suggests I hope that *A Life Engineering Software* turned out to be more measured and moderate. I think I'm about ready for a bit more of that in my life as well as my blog.
